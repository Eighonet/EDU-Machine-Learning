0,2021,ERI,Eritrea,"President of the General Assembly; Your Excellency Antonio Gutierrez,  Secretary general of the United Nations; Ladies and Gentlemen, It is an honor for me to address this august Assembly of States - albeit virtually - on behalf of the President of the State of Eritrea, H.E. Mr. Isaias Afwerki. In  this  regard,  allow  me  to  congratulate  Your  Excellency,  on  behalf  of  the Government and People of Eritrea, on your election as  the President for the 76th Session  of the United Nations. You have our full support  as we  are aware of  the enormity of your responsibilities. I  also  wish  to  express  our  deepest  gratitude  to  your  predecessor,  His  Excellency Volkan  Bozkir,  for  his  astute  leadership  and  successful  conclusion  of  the  75th session.  Mr. President, These  are  crucial,  and  in  many  respects,  unprecedented  times.    Our  global community  is  facing  triple  challenges  of  enormous  gravity;  i)  the  COVID- pandemic whose deadly virulence continues unabated in many places; ii) spiraling climate change that threatens our very survival; and, iii) growing risks of dangerous      international  rivalry  and  commotion  rooted  on  dynamic  changes  in  the  global balance of power.    These grave challenges have accentuated some basic truths.  They have amplified the flaws and inadequacies of  conventional wisdom on certain  economic models. They have exposed structural deficiencies in the parameters of global and domestic governance hitherto portrayed as universal and unassailable both in terms of their universal validity and applicability.    Leaving  aside  the  deleterious  consequences  of  the  Cold-War,  misguided  policies pursued in its immediate aftermath by Special Interest Groups in the US and Europe to maintain and consolidate a  Uni-Polar global order did not usher in a period of international stability and prosperity that would, as it was argued, cascade down to different parts of the world to promote steady social and economic progress.  As it happened, even in advanced countries, income disparity between the rich few – less than  percent of the population  –  and the majority of  other citizens has become ludicrously huge and morally reprehensible with unhealthy social ramifications.   At the international level, heavy-handed policies of containment and encirclement to forestall healthy strategic competition and mutual progress based on symmetric, equitable,  and  rules-based  international  system  has,  and  is  stoking,  a  climate  of confrontation and instability with all the risks that this may entail in the period ahead.  In the event, it is incumbent on all of us to climb down from our high horses and ponder on these issues in a holistic manner; with requisite earnestness and sincerity. As I intimated above, our world is still dealing with the deadly pandemic. The theme for the 76th Session, ""Building resilience through hope – to recover from COVID-,  rebuild  sustainably,  respond  to  the  needs  of  the  planet,  respect  the  rights  of people, and revitalize the United Nations” is, in this sense, apt and optimistic.  But as you know well, the realities facing humanity today are dire and many.  Let me take the opportunity to convey my condolences to and express my solidarity with all Member States and all the families of those who have lost loved ones due to the COVID- global pandemic.  Mr. President, Whether meeting internationally agreed development goals, combating the growing threat of climate change, or responding to the range of threats to international peace and security, the enormity of today’s global challenges call for a stronger United Nations that is more representative, transparent and most importantly, effective. As we stated last year, the pursuit and ideals of enduring global peace, stability and prosperity are squarely predicated, and can only flourish, on the edifice of a robust global organization that can measure up to all these challenges. This indelible fact is more evident than ever before.  In the event, allow me to renew our call for the strengthening and revamping of the UN  system  whose  authority  and  efficacy  have  been  corroded  in  past  decades. Unfortunately,  multilateral  institutions  have  been  rendered  impotent,  due  to  the unilateral actions of a select few.  Mr. President In the Horn of Africa, economic problems due to the COVID pandemic have been compounded by a dangerous conflict that stems from decades of misguided policies by certain major players as I will elaborate later.   To this one must also add growing tensions we have witnessed in the past months in the wider region on issues of border dispute and the Renaissance Dam.  In Eritrea’s view,  these  are  not  intractable  problems  beyond  direct  resolution  by  the  parties concerned through political goodwill and good-faith negotiations to advance mutual and long-term benefits to all the principal stakeholders.  In regard to the Renaissance Dam in particular, acrimonious and internationalized forums will likely hinder an enduring  and  comprehensive  arrangement  that  addresses  the  requirements  of  the principal riparian States – i.e., Ethiopia, the Sudan, and Egypt –   within a framework of  robust  and  long-term  cooperation  and  available  technological  options  and solutions.  Mr. President,    As Your Excellency will recall, the Joint Declaration of Peace and Friendship that Eritrea and Ethiopia signed in July 2018 had ushered in a new epoch of hope and optimism.  The significance of this historic achievement was vividly visible in the massive euphoria that it generated among the peoples of Eritrea and Ethiopia.   But  the  TPLF  group  could  not  accept  and  fathom  the  present  realities.    It  thus embarked on multiple acts of subversion both to scuttle the Eritrea-Ethiopia peace process and to regain power in Ethiopia through forceful means.  It  must  be  recalled  here  that  while  in  power  in  Ethiopia,  the  TPLF  continued  to occupy, for almost two decades, sovereign Eritrean territories in flagrant violation of  international  law  and  the  Arbitral  Award  of  the  Eritrea-Ethiopia  Boundary Commission.    Throughout  this  time,  the  TPLF  continued  to  wage  intermittent assaults  against Eritrea  in order  to  provoke  a  major war.    And  while  the Eritrea-Ethiopia  Peace  Agreement  stipulated  Ethiopia’s  unequivocal  adherence  to,  and implementation of the EEBC Border Verdict, the TPLF continued to obstruct good-faith enforcement of this solemn agreement. In  Ethiopia  too,  the  TPLF  resorted  to  various  illicit  subterfuges  to  roll  back  the positive  process  underway  through  popular  will.    And  as  a  culmination  and dangerous  escalation  of  its  subversive  measures,  it  unleashed  a  massive  War  of Insurrection  against  Ethiopian’s  Northern  Command  with  the  express  aims  of neutralizing this biggest contingent, confiscating its weaponry, to thereby forcefully seize  power  in  Ethiopia.    TPLF’s  aims  included  subsequent  military  acts  of aggression against Eritrea. The grave danger that these reckless and illicit acts by this rogue group to Ethiopia, Eritrea  and  the  Horn  of  Africa  region  as  a  whole  is  too  evident  to  merit  further elaboration.    But  what  we  find  inexcusable  is  the  position  of  certain  countries, notably the US and its European allies, to defend the TPLF’s illicit and dangerous acts  of  insurrection  and  mayhem  and  marshal  all  the  tools  in  their  disposal  to rehabilitate  it  at  any  cost.    I  will  not  waste  your  time  here  to  recount  the  false narratives they have floated to create moral equivalence between the principal culprit and those compelled to take deterrent and reactive action warranted by international law and established State practice. This  act  in  itself  underlines  the  structural  inadequacy  of  the  global  governance system  that  I  intimated  earlier  in  my  speech.  Eritrea  has  suffered  enormously  by similar previous acts.  These should not recur again.   The injustices meted on Eritrea by powers who feel they can trample the sovereignty of nations and peoples at their whim must indeed come to an end.   I thank you     "
1,2021,ETH,Ethiopia,"President, Allow me to start by congratulating you and the sisterly  country,  Maldives,  on  your  election  as president  of  the  Seventy-Sixth  Session  of  the General Assembly.  My  appreciation  also  goes  to  Mr.  Volkan Bozkir,  for  his  able  guidance  of  the  Seventy-Fifth Session. Congratulations  is  also  in order  for  Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, for once-again winning the vote of confidence to serve the United Nations.  I  also  thank  the  host  country  for  the  facilities availed to us in the midst of a global pandemic.  Mr. President, This year’s General Assembly takes place while we  continue  to  grapple  with  the  COVID- pandemic.  The pandemic rattled all aspects of public and private life. It also revealed the power of innovation and the enormous potential of scientific research to serve humanity.    I would like to take a moment to applaud the scientists, engineers, and everyone who have played a part in the discovery and rollout of the COVID- vaccine.   Evidently,  science  can  serve  humanity  only  if good faith  and rationality  guides  politics. Unfortunately,  Africa,  with  negligible  vaccination rate is left waiting for the drips from the surplus of others due to vaccine nationalism.  In  addition,  the  economic  devastation in developing countries from the pandemic is yet to be addressed  by  meaningful  economic  and  financial measures.  We  hope,  countries  with  the  means,  would advance cooperation that is cognizant of the global nature of the problem.  With this pandemic, there is no isolated safety.  No one is safe until everyone is safe.       Mr. President, The true dignity and freedom of people lies with their  ability  to  sustain  themselves.  Poverty  and dependance  on foreign  aid  cause  political, governance,  security,  and  human  development challenges.  Global-warming is the most alarming driver of poverty. Agrarian and pastoralist communities and economies  like  ours  with  these  livelihoods  face  an existential challenge.  The  impacts  of  climate  change  are  destroying arable land and biodiversity thereby disrupting our food  system.  Production  of  cash  crops  suffer  from quality and quantity problems. Perennial flood and drought are straining  the emergency readiness  we have in place.   The  targets  under  the  environment  and sustainable  development  agenda  are  overdue  and can no more be overtaken by events.      Hopefully, COP- will pave the way for climate financing  and  support  to  programs  such  as  the Green  Belt  and  Green  Legacy  afforestation initiatives that are restoring a long-lost ecosystem.  Mr. President,  In  the  past  few  years,  we  heard  from  this podium voices of justified concern and call for rule-based world order and viable multilateralism.  Ethiopia,  has  always  been  steadfast  in  its support  for  multilateral  institutions.  Our  position emanates  not  from  rhetoric  but  from  our  tragic ordeal during the days rule-based order was left in the shambles.   We  commend  the  declaration  of  return  and renewal of commitment to multilateralism.  At the same  time,  we  see  a  glaring  need  to  reiterate  the fundamental  values  of  sovereign-equality,  non-interference,  and  cooperation  based  on  mutual benefit and respect.     Multilateralism  stands  on  the  shoulders  of states that ably-guard their sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence. Multilateralism will meet its objective only if states are  able  and  free  to  manage  their  domestic  and external affairs.  Indeed,  our  human  aspirations  are  inherently similar.  However,  our  viewpoints that  are underpinned  by  our  diversity  in  cultures,  history, and socio-economic reality will not always be fully-aligned.   This diversity shall be viewed as an asset and no one amongst us should wish to prevail over the other,  especially  when  it  comes  to  values  and policies  dealing  with  our  internal  and  external affairs.           Mr. President, Three  years  ago,  my  country,  Ethiopia embarked  on  a  promising  journey  of  reform.  The changes  we  introduced,  ushered-in  democracy, human  rights,  human  development,  and  regional stability.  It  also  opened  avenues  for  dialogue  and unity among divergent political and interest groups.   Tapping into  Ethiopia’s  rich  history  and enormous  potential, the  reform  charted  our inevitable and bright future - placing Ethiopia as a new horizon of hope. It overturned a complex network of corruption, illegitimate political power, and illicit financial flows -- installed at the cost of national interest and the detriment of regional peace.  The reform,  however,  was  not  without challenges.   As  any  other  democracy,  our democratic process is an attempt to find a balance between stability and disruption.    In  Ethiopia,  groups  that  consider  equality  as subjugation  are  making  their  best  effort  to  create and prolong anarchy.   At  the  hands  of  these  lords  of  instability,  we went  through  unimaginably  inhumane  attacks against  citizens, instigation  of  violence,  and destruction  of  property,  that  culminated  in  an attack against the Ethiopian army.   On  the  night  of  November  four  last  year,  in  a scheme  orchestrated  by  a  criminal  group,  the Ethiopian  National  Defense  Force  was  attacked from within. The unsuspecting men and women in uniform were slain.   The Government of Ethiopia, took the necessary measures to avert the grave danger imposed on us.   Mr. President  While the government  was  addressing humanitarian  needs,  the  disruptors  applied  their cruel design to aggravate human suffering. We were also  caught  by  surprise,  and to-be-honest, unprepared for the twisted propaganda campaign.    Little  did  we  know  the  power  of  privatized politics and foreign policy that clouds the truth from policy decisions.  The criminal enterprise and its enablers created and advertised horrific imagery of faked incidents. As  if  the  real  misery  of  our  people  is  not  enough, story  lines  are  created  to  match  not  the  facts  but preconceived stereotypical attitudes.   The  Government  of  Ethiopia  meeting-out  its obligation to fulfil  humanitarian  needs, the declaration of  humanitarian ceasefire, the commissioning of investigations, and accountability measures  have  not  mitigated  the  propaganda campaigns.  At this stage,  we are nearly convinced humanitarian assistance is a pretext for advancing political considerations.  Accused by agenda-and-revenue driven media, convicted by misguided politics, we are now facing a  unilateral  coercive  measure.  Ethiopia  opposed coercive  measures,  when  it  was  applied  against others,  we  advise  against its  application  on   Ethiopia.  Prescriptions  and  punitive  measures never helped improve situations or relations. Mr. President  The prudent measures we will continue to take are commensurate with the existential challenge we face. Despite the undue pressure, we shall live up to the solemn obligation to preserve the sovereignty, territorial integrity and the political independence of Ethiopia. While cooperation and concern from our friends is  welcome,  we  underline  the  need  to  employ constructive  approach,  cultivate  trust  and  ensure understanding. Attempts to extend support or even opine  on  an  internal  issue  of  a  state  requires  full understanding  about  the  complexities  of  the problem.   It shall be noted, the challenge we are facing is not limited to the boundaries of Ethiopia. The entire region is facing the destructive path paved for it by this  group.  Supporting  Ethiopia  overcome  this criminal group is helping sustain regional peace.   Dialogue has always been our preferred course of  action.  Accordingly,  Ethiopia  is  open  to  candid initiatives for peace. In this connection, we will work with the African Union and the High Representative for  the  Horn  of  Africa  towards  an  Ethiopia  led national dialogue. We only hope, the African Union will be given the space to apply its own wisdom.   I also underscore my government’s unreserved commitment  for  the  provision  of  humanitarian assistance  and  facilitate  the  operation  of  our humanitarian partners that adhere to the principles of neutrality, independence and humanity and the laws of the country.  Apart from this, no excuse will justify  any  attempt  to  intervene  in  our  internal affairs.  Mr. President,  Had  it  been  for  the  plans  of  the  internal  and external destabilizers, Ethiopia would have turned into rubles where the greedy and the archaic feast and thrive.      Not only that, the political map of the Horn of Africa  would  have  altered,  worsening  its  existing volatility.  With  the  resilience  of  its  people,  and  the foundational  cultural  and  religious  diversity  that made up Ethiopia’s society,  Ethiopia will continue overcoming its adversaries.  Ethiopia will always be a beacon of freedom and symbol of peace. As a nation that had never posed threat to security of other states, we will maintain our support to regional and global stability. At this historic juncture, Ethiopia demands and Ethiopia deserves a similar cooperation it extended to others in the aftermath of attacks targeting their institutions.  Mr. president, The political and security landscape in Africa is on  a  path  of  adversity.  Forcible  overthrow  of governments,  joint  military  exercises,  aggression, renewed  appetite  for  intervention  in  sovereign countries, subversion and  mercenaryism,   normalized  and  renewed  scramble  for  natural resources,  secret  military  pacts,  geo-political competitions and others are becoming pervasive.  Unless we swiftly change course, this will be yet another round to  destabilize  Africa and disenfranchise Africans in the determination of our destiny. We hope there will be more countries to lift the  banner  of  multilateralism  rather  than  the vagaries of unilateralism.   Accordingly,  Ethiopia  stands  ready  to  avail bilateral  mechanisms  and  diplomatic  solutions  to resolve  the  border  dispute  with  Sudan.  It  is incumbent upon our two  governments to work for peace  for  the  sake  of  our  people  that  have  the strongest bond of fraternity.  Mr. President  The past year has also seen a milestone for the people of Ethiopia. Our experiment with democracy ascended  one  level  with  a  free,  fair,  peaceful,  and credible  election  with  an  unprecedented  level  of voter turnout.     The  Grand  Ethiopian  Renaissance  Dam  –  a hydroelectric  dam  project  we fully financed underwent  a  second-year  filling.  Hopefully,  we inspired  others  to  develop  local  capability  to  plan, finance, and complete renewable energy projects. However,  our  humble  attempt  to  light  the houses of millions of Ethiopians and create hope for our  youth  is  politicized  before  global  bodies.  This peoples' project also received unending threats.     Ironically,  we  are  accused  and  threatened  for drinking from our water.  On the matter of the Nile and the GERD, our confidence is in the might of the truth, wisdom and justice that has always defined our path for cooperation.   The  generational  desire  to  use  our  natural resources  will  not  be  stopped  by  a  colonial  legacy and  monopolistic  cause.  We  hope  our  negotiating partners are prepared for a win-win outcome under the African Union led process.      Mr. President, I  would  like  to  conclude  my  statement  with  a very  important  note  on  the  role  of  my  country  in peacekeeping.    Our troops successfully completed missions in Darfur and Abyei.  They paid the ultimate sacrifice in  the  most  isolated  mission  areas,  facing  active intercommunal  clashes,  unconventional  warfare methods, border disputes, and  unabated administrative obstructions.  Our  troops  have  done  justice  to  the  most cherished  name  of  their  country  through  their service and sacrifice.  I pay them my respects and express our pride.   With the impending transition  of the peacekeeping  mission  in  Abyei,  I  would  like  to convey  our  best  wishes  for  our  two  neighbors  to amicably  resolve  their  territorial  dispute.  We  hope the sacrifices we made will not be in vain.    I thank you,  Mr. President, and assure  you of Ethiopia’s full support for successful completion of your PRESIDENCY OF HOPE. I thank you     "
2,2021,KEN,Kenya,"President of the 76th Session of the General Assembly, H.E. Antnio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, Excellencies,  Ladies and Gentlemen, . I am delighted to join you today in this 76th session of the General Assembly. I  congratulate  you  Mr.  President  on  your  election  to  preside  over  the  76th Session, and assure you of Kenya’s full support during your tenure.  .  The theme for this Year’s Session — 'Building resilience through hope to recover from COVID-’ — has inspired my address today.  . The Secretary General in his report on Our Common Agenda observed, and I quote:  “Humanity  faces  a  stark  and  urgent  choice:  breakdown  or breakthrough.” . The world needs to take seriously this warning from the Secretary General. In doing this I urge the following immediate multilateral actions: (i) First, we must put equitable global vaccine access at the core of “Building Back Better” from the COVID- pandemic;  (ii) Second, we need to provide tangible climate financial support to developing  countries  and  ensure  that  a  significant  portion  of  “green manufacturing” is located in developing countries; (iii) Third, we must align our conflict resolution tools to the strategic shift in threats to regional and international peace and security;            (iv) Fourth,  we  must  strengthen  the  competence  of  states  to  manage diversity  and  regional  trust  between  citizens  and  institutions,  and between citizens and their leaders.  Ladies and Gentlemen, . As  of  a  week  ago,  close  to  five  thousand  Kenyans  had  succumbed  to COVID-.  We  mourn  these  Kenyans  and  the  .  million  lives  that  have been  lost  around  the  world.  The  pandemic’s  devastating  impact  on  global travel,  tourism,  supply  chains  and  investment  has  caused  the  deepest economic recession in nearly a century.  .  Kenya  responded swiftly  and  boldly  to  contain  the  pandemic;  and,  as a result, the human toll, though most distressing, pales in comparison to other parts of the world.  .  While we also undertook measures to cushion different sectors of our economy, the economic pain has been, pronounced. Now is the time to rebuild. . To rebuild successfully requires a worldwide response in confidence and investment  to  enable  production and consumption  to  bounce back to pre-pandemic levels. The surest way to building that confidence is by making vaccines available to the world, in an equitable and accessible manner. That,  sadly,  is  currently  not  the  case.  The  asymmetry  in  the  supply  of vaccines reflects a multilateral system that is in urgent need for repair.  .   At the heart of the global effort to “Building Back Better”, we must make concerted, structural changes that should enable a quantum increase in           investment and technology transfers. Not as charity, but instead driven by enlightened self-interest and solidarity.  .  A  fast-developing  Africa  will  offer  the  entire  world  the  benefit  of  its demographic  dividend  of  youth  and  vast  investment  opportunities. Africa can become an engine of sustainable global growth and an exporter of peace and stability and transformative prosperity. .  Excellencies,  many  leaders  have  noted,  on  previous  occasions,  the need  to  deliver  concurrently  economic  recovery  linked  to  climate change  action.  As  COP-  approaches,  we  should  aim  to  make  clear commitments  that  contribute  to  developing  country  investments  in  green manufacturing and the infrastructure it requires.  .  A “Green Building Back Better” that delivers jobs and shared prosperity, will win the support of the young generation and intensify the drive towards climate change action.  Mr. President, .  Kenya is ready to become a leading green industry country. We have mounted a strong climate change response. We have submitted an updated National Determined Contribution (NDC) plan that aims to lower greenhouse gas emissions by % by 2030.  .  Kenya also has a “Green Economy Strategy and Implementation Plan (2016-2030)”, which will enable us to achieve higher economic growth and support a low-carbon development path.          .  Kenya has also identified a range of ocean based adaptation priorities to integrate  Ocean-based  climate  solutions  with  the  global  response  to  climate change. .  We  look  forward  to  co-hosting  the  second  United  Nations  Ocean Conference with Portugal in late June 2022, to galvanise commitments and partnerships  that  will  promote  ambitious  global  ocean  action,  and  scale  up investments in the Blue Economy.  .  This follows Kenya’s successful co-hosting of the first global “Sustainable Blue Economy Conference” in 2018, with Japan, Canada and other partners. Mr. President,  .  Kenya is, blessed with a youthful, well-educated, and productive population that has managed to  build one of the  most vibrant mixed economies in Africa. .  We are implementing ambitious programmes to prepare the country to produce decent and rewarding jobs. Our investments in roads, air and port infrastructure, and critical health care facilities throughout the country, are the most extensive and ambitious in our history.  .  We have also delivered a national competency based curriculum and on universal access to schooling, which will further boost competitiveness of our workforce.  .  My Administration is simultaneously focusing on the immediate needs of our people. We have targeted . million households that are most at risk           and  in  the  process  achieved  a    percent  reduction  in  the  number  of  food insecure Kenyans.  .  By  next  year,  we  will  have  achieved  a  %  reduction  in  malnutrition among children under  years of age, created ,000 agro-processing SMEs and  600,000  new  jobs.  We  will  also  have  recorded  a  %  increase  in agriculture sector contribution to GDP.  Excellencies,  Ladies and Gentlemen, .  As  the  President-in-Office  of  African,  Caribbean  and  Pacific  States Organisation,  I  convened  and  chaired  an  extraordinary  inter-Sessional Virtual Summit, at the height of the COVID- pandemic in June last year.  .  We made the Nairobi “Nguvu ya Pamoja” Declaration calling for the need to transcend the COVID- pandemic through global solidarity.  .  I also recently hosted the inaugural Africa – CARICOM Summit, during which  we  re-established  the  critical  need  for  peoples  of  African  descent  to strengthen our economic and political linkages. It was a historic and proud moment  for  me  personally  to  be  part  of  the  great  legacy  of  Pan Africanism in our world! .  What ties these events, and others that I have participated in during the last year, is the collective conviction that the global system is not working well for all our people and all our regions. .  The unequal trade and investment patterns, the outflows of illicit finance and inflows of illicit small arms and light weapons, the extraction versus production          mentality,  are  all  escalating  global  inequality,  fragility,  conflict  and  violence.   Many of the tools at our disposal to deal with these challenges are not living  up  to  their  promise.  One  such  core  tool  is  the  United  Nations Security Council in which Kenya has been an elected an active member since the beginning of the year. .  In  October  2021,  Kenya  will  assume  the  Presidency  of  the  Security Council. During that period, I will chair several signature-events. These include; one, how we can make an appreciation for diversity, a core aim in promoting  state  building  and  the  pursuit  of  peace.  Second,  how  illicit  small arms and light weapons impact peacekeeping operations; and third is how to better support and promote women peacekeepers and peace builders.  Excellencies, .  In  many  countries,  we  are  witnessing  state  fragility  that  leads  to protracted  crises.  This  fragility  is,  driven  mainly  by  inability  of  countries  to manage diversity within nations, thus offering militant and terrorist groups opportunities  to  create  social  discontent  and  control  large  territories  within affected countries.  .  The  tools  to  deal  with  these  crises  are  not  proving  adequate;  so  we must  work  to  improve  their  capabilities.  The  most  important  task  we  can undertake  is  to  increase  the  competence  of  states  to  manage  both political and social diversity within their nation states. .  Indeed,  countries  must  do  so  in  a  way  that  strengthens  the  trust between citizens and public institutions and citizens and their leaders. I  believe  that  the  tough  experiences  that  Kenya  has  had,  and  our         determination  to  rise  above  them,  are  a  good  case  study  for  other states. Mr. President,  .  I  am  proud  to  lead  a  country  that  has  worked  hard  to  deepen  its democracy and to entrench the rule of law, embracing all in the society irrespective of race, colour, gender or religious affiliation.  .  Throughout my tenure as the President, I have led a nation that is marching forward  to  attain the “Greatness We Believe, Is In Us”. I  am  proud  to have furthered that ambition by building bridges of unity and inclusion for all.  .  I want every Kenyan to know and to be proud of how our nation, Kenya, is highly regarded in the “Community of Nations”. Kenyans must never forget the hand-of-friendship that extended to us on various times, by many states seated  in  this  General  Assembly;  nor  what  our  contribution  has  been  to  the international community.  .  Finally,  Kenya  must  never  forget  those  countries  that  still  struggle  against occupation and illegal sanctions that cause suffering and undermine the human rights of people in our world. .  As I conclude, we offer our solidarity and commitment as a Member State of the United Nations to undertake the journey back to recovery and to prosperity, “building forward better” in a multilateral system that is fair and effective.            Mr. President, I Thank You. God Bless You All! ----------------------------------     "
3,2021,MWI,Malawi,"President  of  the  76th  Session  of  the  General Assembly; •  Your  Excellency  Mr.  Antonio  Guterres  –  UN Secretary-General; •  Excellencies Heads of State and Government; •  Ladies and Gentlemen.           By  the  time  I  finish  speaking,  close  to  five thousand  new  babies  will  have  entered  our troubled  world.  In  fact,  the  number  of  babies  to be  born  in  the    days  of  this  debate  is  over   million. Now, this new crop of humanity and billions more to come in the next  years, has no voice and no vote at this assembly. Yet it is they, not we, who will live in the future we create here. The task of choosing that future for them lies with us. This assembly  is  a  fork  in  the  road  where  we  must choose between two futures for our children and their children.  We must choose for our children a future of zero carbon  emissions;  or  a  future  of  daily  climate catastrophes that wipe out crops, homes, cities, and some nations in this room.      We  must  choose  for  our  children  a  future  of solidarity,  hospitality,  and  generosity  that transcend  borders  and  national  identities  in times  of  global  crisis;  or  a  future  of  greed  that hoards  life-saving  technologies,  medicines,  and vaccines  in  one  hemisphere  while  the  other hemisphere  is  robbed  of  its  raw  materials  and left perishing. We must choose for our children a future of peace fostered  by  equitable  sustainable  development between  north  and  south  and  between  east  and west;  or  a  future  of  conflicts  triggered  by  the widening  economic  inequality  between  rich  and poor, men and women, young and old. We must choose for our children a future of good governance delivered through strong democratic         institutions that safeguard human rights, uphold the rule of law, and maintain world peace; or a future  of  corrupt  and  oppressive  governments propped  up  by  proxy  wars  between  developed nations and enabled by a weak and undemocratic United  Nations  that  serves  the  interests  of  its Security  Council  at  the  expense  of  its  member states’ development and inclusion.  The  place  to  make  that  choice  is  here,  and  the time to make that choice is now. Here and now, we  must  move  with  speed  and  synergy  to  pull civilization  out  of  this  sinking  wreckage.  Here and now, we must silence our petty and narrow interests  to  give  voice  to  our  shared  desire  to build back better and leave no one behind. Here and now, we must answer the four crises that are before us: the climate crisis, the Covid crisis, the sustainable  development  crisis,  and  the  UN Governance crisis.       Now,  the  starting  points  for  answering  each  of these  crises  are  simple.  For  the  Climate  Crisis, the  starting  point  is  three  words:  Fulfil  Your Pledge.  It’s  been  over  ten  years  since  the developed  nations  that  polluted  our  planet  the most pledged 100 billion dollars towards climate mitigation  and  adaptation.  These  are  nations that  tell  the  rest  of  us  to  follow  their  example, nations  that  tell  us  to  consider  them  friends, nations  that  call  us  corrupt  and  untrustworthy when we say one thing and do another, nations that  tell  us  that  they  are  the  leaders  in  this global village.  Well,  it’s  time  to  show  that  leadership.  Fulfil Your  Pledge.  Mind  you,  this  is  not  a  donation. This is a cleaning fee, because if you pollute the planet we all call home, it is only right that you should pay to clean it up. So Fulfil Your Pledge. No ifs, no buts, no ands.    Similarly, the starting point for ending the Covid Crisis is three words: Release the Vaccines. It is reported  that  half  a  billion  vaccine  doses  being kept  by  developed  countries  will  expire  in  three months.  What  are  you  waiting  for?  Release  the Vaccines.  Release  the  vaccine  doses  and  the vaccine production rights to save human lives. In most  of  the    member  states  of  the  Least Developed  Countries  (LDCs)  and  the    member states  of  the  Southern  Africa  Development Community (SADC), both of which are chaired by Malawi, vaccination rates are below %. The rate would be at % were it not for the COVAX Facility coordinated  by  Gavi,  the  Vaccine  Alliance,  the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the World Health Organization.  With  such  limited  access  to  vaccines,  we  have had to make the most of preventive and remedial measures.  In  Malawi  alone,  we  have  brought    three  waves  of  the  pandemic  under  control without the  use  of lockdowns;  we  have constructed  and  staffed  recovery  centres  in record time; we have treated Covid patients and registered  a  recovery  rate  of  over  %;  we  have cut  infection  rates  down  from  %  to  less  than %; we have kept the death toll from Covid below 3000;  and  we  have  facilitated  monthly  cash transfers  to  support  thousands  of  households exposed to loss of income by the pandemic.  But  in  a  world  where  the  virus  keeps  mutating and  spreading,  the  measures  we  have  employed to achieve all this are not sustainable. The most effective weapon we need is the vaccine. As such, you can imagine our disappointment to be at an assembly  like  this,  rubbing  shoulders  with nations that are now administering booster shots while most of our people have yet to get their first one. This form of vaccine nationalism is wrong. It    is  insensitive.  And  it  must  end.  Release  the Vaccines. At  the  same  time,  to  help  us  recover  from  the economic  devastation  caused  by  this  pandemic, the  starting  point  is  three  words:  Cancel  the Debts.  This  is  the  single  most  impactful  thing that  would  help  developing  nations  like  Malawi build  back  better  and  not  be  left  behind.  We already  have  a  Social  Economic  Recovery Programme  for  addressing  the  socio-economic impacts of the pandemic. But what is missing is the  debt  cancellation  that  will  help  us  focus  on recovery. The effectiveness of this approach has already  been  proven  by  the  G20  Debt  Service Suspension  Initiative  (DSSI).  So,  I  say  again: Cancel the Debts.     As  for  the  sustainable  development  crisis,  the starting point for progress is again three words: Let’s Work Together. As a global community, we are  off  track  on  a  number  of  sustainable development  goals,  and  there  is  no  path  of progress  towards  achieving  the  2030  Agenda that  does  not  involve  working  together  across borders, across sectors, and across SDGs.  The need to work together on SDGs is why I was happy to host the 41st Summit of SADC Heads of State and Government in Malawi.  The need to work together on SDGs is why I was happy to host a Pre-UN Food Systems Summit for African  Heads  of  State  and  Government,  where we  shared  what  we  have  learnt  from  the successful  implementation  of  the  Affordable Inputs  Programme (AIP),  which increased     Malawi’s  food  production  by  %  in  its  first season.  The need to work together on SDGs is why I was happy to address the first ever Summit for Heads of State from Africa and CariCom.  The need to work together on SDGs is why I am happy  that  Malawi  is  one  of    nations  that  are Global  Champions  on  SDG7  to  achieve  clean energy for all by 2030.  The need to work together on SDGs is why I am looking forward to host a Climate Conference for SADC  next  month, in  readiness for  our collaboration with other regions at the upcoming COP26 in Glasgow.       The need to work together on SDGs is why I am looking  forward  to  meeting  other  LDCs  for  the fifth Summit of our grouping in Doha this coming January.  Let’s  work  together,  because  even  though  my country  has  a  ten-year  implementation  plan  for achieving  Agenda  2030  on  SDGs,  much  of  that plan cannot be done in isolation. The bottom line is,  if  one  nation  among  us  fails  or  succeeds  to achieve sustainable development, so do the rest. This  need  to  work  together  brings  me  to  the fourth  and  final  crisis  confronting  us:  the  UN Governance  Crisis.  In  a  world  that  needs multilateralism  more  than  ever  to  tackle  the global challenges we face, the United Nations is indispensable. As such, the UN must be the gold standard of democracy, accountability,     transparency,  and  equity.  It  is  therefore  our position that the starting point for creating a UN that reflects these values is three words: Reform this institution.  One reform urgently needed is the implementation  of  the  African  Union’s  Ezulwini Consensus, which demands two Permanent Seats for  Africa,  with  Veto  Power,  on  the  UN  Security Council and five Non-Permanent Seats. It is time for the United Nations to practice the democratic values it preaches. That is the UN we want for the millions of new-borns entering the troubled world we have created, because that is the UN they can trust to create a better world. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION      "
4,2021,MUS,Mauritius,"President of the General Assembly, Secretary General of the United Nations, Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates. Mr. President, It is indeed a great pleasure to see you steering the proceedings of the 76th Session of  the  General  Assembly  of  the  United  Nations.    Mauritius  and  Maldives  share common challenges as developing islands of the Indian Ocean.  We wish to assure you of our full cooperation and support during your Presidency. I extend my gratitude to H.E. Mr. Volkan Bozkır for his successful Presidency of the last Session.  Let me also congratulate His Excellency Mr. Antnio Guterres upon his re-election as Secretary-General of the United Nations and thank him for his comprehensive report entitled “Our Common Agenda”.  Mr. President, You  have  chosen  a  very  appropriate  theme  for  this  session  given  the  unique situation we are in for the past  months. Building  resilience  through  hope,  recovering  from  COVID-,  rebuilding sustainably, responding to the needs of the planet, respecting the rights of people, and revitalizing the United Nations cover the whole range of activities which are not  only  urgent  but  also  crucial  if  we  are  to  ensure  our  long  term  continued existence  on  our  planet,  in  a  manner  that  enhances  multilateralism  and cooperation, protects the rights of people by reinforcing our institutions and the Rule of Law, and leaves no one behind. The  COVID-  pandemic  caught  a  totally  unprepared  world  with  unparalleled intensity,  disrupting  governments  and  societies,  the  multilateral  system,  and more importantly, the lives and livelihood of people. Page  of                It  has  brought  to  light  the  scale  of  global  interconnectedness.  Events  in  one country can have rippling effects across the globe.  Almost two years later, we are still grappling with the pandemic and its mutations and despite the fact that vaccines have come out amazingly fast, we are still not in a position to say that life is back to normal.  In  fact,  just  as  many  countries  were  finding  it  hard  to  find  basic  protective equipment  at  the  beginning  of  the  pandemic,  they  are  now  facing  similar challenges to have access to affordable and effective vaccines.  While advanced economies have been able to deploy massive fiscal stimulus to cushion  the  pandemic’s  impact  and  have  succeeded  in  achieving  mass vaccinations, the policy response of developing countries has been constrained by several factors, and access to vaccines is still limited. Inequitable vaccine distribution is not only leaving millions of people vulnerable to the virus, but it is also allowing new variants to emerge, with the result that recovery will take longer.  We welcome the US initiative to organize a Leaders’ Summit to consider ways of eradicating  the  Pandemic.  The  meeting  held  this  week  shows  that  bringing together  World  Leaders,  economic  partners,  and  vaccine  producers,  and  the scientific community can lead to concerted actions to fight the pandemic.  We  should  strive  towards  producing  more  vaccines,  more  rapidly,  and decentralize  their  production  to  cater  for  the  needs  of  the  people  around  the globe.  Multilateral facilities such as the COVAX should be fully funded and empowered to redistribute surplus vaccine doses. Necessary technology and resources should be shared with developing countries, including SIDS like Mauritius, to enable the roll out of vaccines for faster return to normalcy.  In the same vein, unilateral economic sanctions should be reviewed in light of the humanitarian urgency to fight the pandemic.  Page  of               Mr. President, With these initiatives, we stand a good chance to eradicate the pandemic or at the very least, be able to learn to live with it, but the world will still have to face the economic challenge that has come with the pandemic.  COVID- has severely impacted the world economy.  Mauritius was not spared and our GDP contracted by .% in 2020.  Public health spending has had to be increased significantly, together with a string of  measures  to  assist  business  transformation,  support  the  tourism  sector, increase local food production, and support various sectors of the economy.  Along with the pandemic, Mauritius has also faced other challenges concerning its financial services sector, and we have had to address these as a matter of great urgency in order to keep the sector afloat. Mr. President, Before  the  pandemic,  Small  Island  Developing  States  were  already  facing significant levels of debt distress.   While  we  welcome  the  G20  Debt  Service  Suspension  Initiative,  we  believe  this facility should be extended to include Small Island Developing States, in particular the Middle-Income Countries as well. A new global financial architecture focusing on fiscal space and debt sustainability is urgently needed for SIDS. fully  supports  the  proposal  to  produce  a  Multidimensional Mauritius Vulnerability Index to be used in determining the type and measure of support that will be needed by a country, not only to build its resilience, but also to put it on track to achieve its SDGs. Page  of                    Mr. President, The Paris Agreement was hailed as a major breakthrough in our efforts to tackle climate change, but the climate events since, show that unless we commit to doing much more, our planet, and indeed our existence, are severely threatened. The  last Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report is unequivocal, we are in the red and human influence is to a large extent responsible for the state of our atmosphere, ocean, and land. The  world  has  great expectations from the COP26 Summit.   We  all know  what needs  to  be  done;  it  is  not  sufficient  to  simply  raise  ambitions,  but  more importantly, we need to commit to deliver on them.  We owe this to future generations.  Mauritius welcomes the fact that the Green Climate Fund has nearly reached the level of contributions that has been pledged.  But this will be meaningless unless access to it is simplified, especially for SIDS.  Mr. President, Oceans are hosts to huge amounts and varieties of biodiversity that need to be protected. We support ongoing work for a legally binding instrument on biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction that would allow an equitable sharing of benefits.   Mr. President, The  protection  and  promotion  of  human  rights  and  gender  equality  should remain at the center of all our endeavours. We have an immense responsibility towards our future generations.  Throughout the  world,  students  and  young  people  have  been  facing  growing  frustration because  of  confinements,  education  disruptions,  and  fewer  job  opportunities.  Page  of                  Special efforts need to be made to bring them in the mainstream.  Mauritius stands ready to support all initiatives in that regard. Mr. President,  One  sector  which  has  thrived  during  the  pandemic  relates  to  infodemics  and criminal activities in cyberspace.  This has to be addressed globally. We support the elaboration of an international Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes.  Mr. President, The  use  of  force  to  legitimize  governments  is  a  matter  of grave  concern  to  the international community and affects peace and regional stability.  We condemn such acts just as much as we condemn the resurgence of violent extremism and terrorism in Africa. We stand in solidarity with the Afghan people and hope that peace prevails and brings stability to the region.  We support all regional and international initiatives aimed at finding sustainable peaceful solutions. We also call for a just and lasting settlement for the Palestinian people. Mr. President, Mauritius  expresses  the  hope  that  under  your  Presidency,  the  process  of reforming the Security Council in order to make it more representative of the new realities will be accelerated.  The historical injustice done to Africa must be corrected.  Africa should have its rightful place in an expanded Security Council which should also include a seat for SIDS. Page  of                     Mr. President, It remains a matter of concern that more than two years after the International Court of Justice ruled that the decolonization process of Mauritius has not been lawfully  completed  in  view  of  the  unlawful  excision  of  the  Chagos  Archipelago from  its  territory  prior  to  independence,  and  that  the  United  Kingdom  has  an obligation  to  withdraw  its  unlawful  administration  from  the  Archipelago  as rapidly as possible, we still see no action on the part of the colonial power. And  yet,  the  findings  of  the  ICJ  have  been  affirmed  by  UN  General  Assembly Resolution /295 and in January this year, a Special Chamber of ITLOS has held that  those  authoritative  determinations  of  international  law  by  the  ICJ  have binding  legal  effect,  rendering  it  beyond  legitimate  dispute  that  Mauritius  is sovereign over the Chagos Archipelago as an integral part of its national territory. The ITLOS Special Chamber also underscored that in adopting Resolution /295, the  General  Assembly  has  set  out  modalities  for  the  completion  of  the decolonization of Mauritius, which the ICJ has ruled every member of the UN, and UN agency, has an obligation to support. The ITLOS Chamber will now proceed to delimit the maritime boundary between Mauritius  and  Maldives  on  the  basis  of  Mauritius  being  the  Coastal  State  in relation to the Chagos Archipelago.   We note with further satisfaction that Specialized Agencies of the United Nations such as the Universal Postal Union have recently adopted by a large majority a resolution  to  give  practical  effect  to  General  Assembly  Resolution  /295, thereby  ensuring  respect  for  international  law  and  its  obligations  under  the Agreement it signed in 1947 with the UN.   Mauritius looks forward to further implementation of Resolution /295 by other international and regional organizations, with the support of UN Member States.  Mauritius remains committed to implementing a programme for the resettlement in  the  Chagos  Archipelago  of  Mauritian  nationals,  in  particular  those  of Chagossian  origin  who  were  forcibly  removed  by  the  UK  from  the  Chagos Archipelago in violation of their basic human rights. Page  of             I express, on behalf of the Government and people of Mauritius and in particular the Mauritians of Chagossian origin, our sincere gratitude to all the countries that have been supporting us in completing our decolonization and we appeal to the colonial  power  to  comply  with  the  rulings  of  the  international  courts  and the resolutions of the General Assembly.  Compliance with international law is the responsibility of all law-abiding States. Mr. President, I would like to reiterate the commitment of Mauritius to ensuring the continued operation of the defence facility in Diego Garcia.  Mauritius considers the facility vital to the  maintenance  of  international  peace and security in  the  Indo-Pacific region,  and  to  efforts  to  combat  terrorism,  piracy,  and  the  illicit  trafficking  of drugs  and  persons.    In  this  regard,  Mauritius,  as  sovereign  over  the  Chagos Archipelago, which includes Diego Garcia, stands ready to enter into a long-term arrangement with the United States in respect of Diego Garcia.    Mr. President, With  regard  to  Tromelin  which  also  forms  an  integral  part  of  the  territory  of Mauritius,  we  call  for  the  early  resolution  of the  dispute  over  the island  in  the spirit of friendship that characterizes the relations between Mauritius and France. Mr. President, We  can  no  longer  afford  to  be  fractious.    We  need  to  promote,  preserve,  and strengthen multilateralism. Together, we can build more sustainable, equal societies and economies.  Together, we can transform our world into one that recognizes and respects the dignity of every human being. I thank you. ********************* Page  of                  "
5,2021,MOZ,Mozambique,"President,         Mr Secretary General of the United Nations; Distinguished Heads of Delegations;  Excellencies; Ladies and Gentlemen! It is with great pleasure and honour that I take part in the 76th session of the General  Assembly, representing H.E  Filipe Jacinto Nyusi,  President of the  Republic  of  Mozambique,  who  due  to  pressing  issues  related  to  his agenda, couldn’t be here in New York. Excellencies, Let us convey our warm congratulations to His Excellency Abdulla Shahid, for  his  election  to  the  Presidency  of  the  76th  Session  of  the  General Assembly.  We convey our appreciation to the excellent work done by his predecessor His Excellency Volkan Bozkir. To our friend, the Secretary General of the United Nations, His Excellency Antnio Guterres, we convey our words of appreciation for his exceptional leadership.                Excellencies, The  United  Nations  General  Assembly  is  gathered  once  again  at  times characterized by multiple challenges of global nature. The  theme  chosen  for  the  current  session,  reflects  the  unique  and  difficult context in which all the countries in the world find themselves since 2019, on account of the COVID- pandemic. Since  its  outbreak,  we  have  witnessed  notable  efforts  by  different  actors: Governments,  regional  and  international  organizations,  private  sector,  and civil  society,  in  a  joint  effort  to  face  this  global  phenomenon  threatening humanity. It is to commend the central role of the United Nations, including through the World Health Organization, in coordinating actions aimed at mobilizing means and resources to save lives and the world from the pandemic. Mozambique  has  taken  important  measures,  such  as,  introduction  of restrictive measures, increasing testing capacity, community sensitization and capacity building campaigns about the importance of preventive care in the fight against COVID-.  Preventive care measures included putting in place public health and social measures and the distribution of vaccinnes. Excellencies            One of the main challenges we, the developing countries, such as ours, are faced with, relate to access to essential medicines and vaccines. We  believe  that  the  private  sector  and  the  International  Cooperation Partners have a crucial role to play in providing support and building the critical infrastructure needed to administer vaccines. We are in favour of a temporary waiver of certain clauses of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), to allow an efficient response to the COVID- pandemic.   Vaccines represent today, an essential good, intrinsincally linked to the right to live/life, a fundamental right which is incumbent on all of our countries to defend. Historically, humanity has shown resilience when faced with great challenges. We are therefore hopeful that once more we shall overcome the pandemic. Given the scarcity in resources, it is imperative that we renew our appeal to the  International  Community  to  channel  its  support  so  that  we  can  jointly successfully defeat COVID-. Its impact on developing countries, challenges us all to find effective resource mobilisation  means  and  mechanisms,  aimed  at  stimulating  the  economic recovery of countries strongly hit by the pandemic, thus ensuring tha we are on track to achieve the Sustainable Deveopment Goals. The  pandemic  had  a  negative  impact  on  the  economic  slowdown  in Mozambique in 2020.          Estimates  indicate  that  we  will  resume  our  economic  recovery  this  year averaging  growth  rates  of  .%  of  GDP,  followed  by  a  more  sustained recovery from 2022 onwards.  We would like to thank, once more, our international partners for the support rendered towards actions aimed at fighting the pandemic. In this context, the revitalization of the United Nations and of multilateralism is of utmost importance. It is furthemore vital to revive the reform agenda of the United Nations in order to give impetus to cohesion, articulation, efficacy and efficiency of inclusive decision-making processes. In  this  context,  the  strengthening  of  cooperation  and  joint  efforts  are essential  to  promote  the  global  agenda  and  of  a  more  just,  equitable, balanced and safe world. Mister President; Excellencies; The world continues to witness threats to international peace and security. The  prevalence  of  terrorism  and  violent  extremism,  combined  with  the proliferation  and  trade  of  arms  constitute  a  serious  threat  to  peace  and security at national, regional and global levels.            The African continent is amongst the most affected regions by terrorism and violent extremism. Terrorism  merits  the  unmitigated  attention  of  the  whole  international community,  particularly  of  the  United  Nations,  given  the  suffering  and bereavement it causes in our respective countries. It is incumbent on all of us to come up with measures on how best to defeat it. In our country, terrorist activities have been registered in some districts of the Cabo Delgado Province, in the northern part of Mozambique. The level of destruction of the socio-economic tissue, the atrocities and massacres,  the  wanton  destruction  of  infra-structure  and  looting  of goods  belonging  to  communities,  have  caused  mourning,  pain  and profound suffering leading to an unprecedented humanitarian crisis. Our  Government  has  embarked  on  a  coordinated  response  to  face terrorism, with the involvement of various partners at national, regional and  international  levels,  and  we  can  highlight  positive  developments and progress in the fight against terrorism. In this context, we count on the support of our regional body, SADC. We also count with the help of the Defense Forces of Rwanda. The  European  Union,  other  international  partners  and  friendly  countries, have provided humanitarian assistance and training and modernization of our Defense and Security Forces.              We wish to thank the international community for the support rendered to our  efforts  in  the  fight  against  terrorism  and  assistance  of  the  displaced population. Excellencies, We  would  like  also  to  thank  the  support  rendered  by  the  international community to the Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration of the former  guerrilla  elements  of  RENAMO, in  the  framework  of  the implementation of the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation. Mister President, Excellencies, Climate related issues are emerging as one of the most pressing issues at international level. The preservation of the human habitat/environment is intrinsically linked to the survival of human civilization. Africa is one of the most vulnerable continents and most prone to natural disasters which are increasing in frequency and intensity.  Mozambique’s location, makes it prone to natural disasters, particularly cyclones, occurring with higher frequency lately.               More than a year and half after the country was hit by cyclone IDAI, efforts are still  ongoing  aimed  at  reconstruction  and  recovery  from  the  socio-economic damages caused. It is therefore for this reason that Mozambique attaches particular importance to concerted  efforts  towards  mitigating  the  effects  of  climate  change  within  the SENDAI  Framework  on  Disaster  Risk  Reduction  and  the  Paris  Agreement  on Climate Change. Climate change continues to pose a major obstacle to the implementation of socio-economic development programs in our countries. Despite our negligible contribution to greenhouse emissions, it is countries like ours that are most affected by climate change, particularly by global warming.  The  cuts  in  international  financing  for  programs  aimed  at  promoting  resilience and adaptation to climate change, has led to an adverse impact and constitutes a major challenge to developing countries. Mister President, Excellencies, We believe that the development goals inscribed in the “Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness”  are  important  elements  in  the  measures  aimed  to  “Rebuild Sustainably” our societies.           Effectively, they are a factor to consider when renewing our commitment to the Decade of Action to Deliver the Sustainable Goals and in the context of the implementation of the Agenda 2030. The  lack  of  resources  could  seriously  jeopardize  the  achievement  of  the objectives under the  Sustainable Development Goals, should current resource mobilization and disbursement patterns remain/persist unchanged. In Mozambique, the implementation of the Agenda 2030 is undertaken in tandem with and aligned with the governments Five Year Program 2020-2024.  Mister President, Excellencies  Our  country  reaffirms its  commitment  towards  the implementation  of international  legal  instruments  aimed  at  strengthening  peace  and  security, particularly  the  Arms  Trade  Treaty,  the  Nuclear  Weapons  Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Conventional Arms Convention.                  Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen Mozambique  has  taken  the  decision  to  present  its  candidature  to  be  Non-Permanent Member of the Security Council, in 2023-2024. In  the  words  of  H.E  Filipe  Jacinto  Nyusi,  President  of  the  Republic  of Mozambique, and I quote: “The importance we attach to peace and security at national,  regional  and  international  levels,  drives  this  historic  decision  to present, for the first time since our independence in 1975, our candidature to the prestigious seat of Non-Permanent Member of the Security Council”. End of quote. In this context, we humbly request the support of all member states of the United Nations towards this objective. Our candidature is an expression of our firm commitment towards building and maintaining international peace and security, the preservation and respect of human rights and the promotion of sustainable development.  We  therefore  reiterate  our  commitment  to  serve  with  dedication  and responsibility  in  order  to  ensure  that  the  principles  and  objectives  of  the  UN Charter remain a source of inspiration to our people in building well-being, peace and global security. We aim to put the modest, yet meaningful experience of Mozambique, at the UN’s disposal in conflict mediation and resolution processes through dialogue.             Let me  end by once again stressing Mozambique’s belief that under the United Nations stewardship and with the support of all member states, the solutions for contemporary problems, albeit challenging, are within reach/attainable. Muito obrigado!       "
6,2021,RWA,Rwanda,"President of the General Assembly   Excellency, Secretary-General Antnio Guterres   Excellencies, Heads of State and Government   Distinguished Delegates Fighting the Covid- pandemic has challenged the international system like never before.   / However,  alongside  unfortunate  examples  of inequality, we have also seen evidence of the spirit of  global  solidarity  and  fairness,  exemplifying  the best values of our organisation. The COVAX mechanism, despite its limitations, is one  such  case.  Without  this  system,  Africa’s vaccine deficit would be even more severe. But we can and must do more, to speed up vaccine distribution in Africa. Doing so benefits the entire world. The  positive  steps  from  various  partners  and companies toward building local vaccine manufacturing capacity is also very welcome.  We must harness this positive momentum to build long-term pandemic resilience, where it is needed most. / The  cooperation  at  the  G7  and  G20  to  issue  new Special  Drawing  Rights is  another  positive example. A  further  voluntary  reallocation  of  new  SDRs  to countries that need them most, will help create the fiscal space required for a faster and more equitable recovery from the pandemic. Nevertheless,  the  world  is  seriously  off-track with the Sustainable Development Goals.   / In fairness, we were behind schedule with the SDGs even  before  the  pandemic  hit.  But  there  is  now increased attention to figuring out how to refocus our efforts, and catch up. We  need  to  convert  this  sense  of  urgency  into  a durable  political  commitment  to  achieving  the SDGs. That  commitment  must  put  climate  change mitigation at the centre of our efforts. The  severity  of  weather-related  disasters is increasing year-by-year. We  cannot  afford  for  the  result  of  COP-  in November to be inconclusive or divisive.  / We  also  need  to  re-emphasise  the  importance  of citizen-centred governance and accountability.  This  not  only  guarantees  well-being  and  material progress,  but  also security, stability,  and confidence in the future. The  extremist  ideologies  that  drive  terrorism  and genocide  must  be  named,  identified  early,  and dismantled, without ambiguity or hesitation. On that, we cannot afford to play politics. I  wish  to  conclude  with  a  strong  endorsement  of the  Secretary-General’s  Report  on  Our  Common Agenda.  / The Secretary-General is right to warn of a possible breakdown  in the  multilateral system,  in the  face of  the  Covid  pandemic,  worsening  conflict,  the climate emergency, and chronic poverty. This would have disastrous consequences for all of us, and the risk should be taken seriously. The Secretary-General’s Action Plan merits our full support,  particularly  the  need for  a  global vaccination  plan,  a  renewal  of  trust  between governments and citizens, more focus on the needs of  youth,  and  a  rejuvenated  commitment  to  fact-based reasoning and science.  / Whether we are able to convene physically for the 77th  General  Assembly  in  2022,  or  for  the Secretary-General’s  proposed  Summit  of  the Future, depends on the actions we all take in the coming months. With determination and focus, it can be achieved. Thank you for your kind attention.  "
7,2021,SYC,Seychelles,"President of the United Nations General Assembly, Mr Secretary-General of  the United Nations, Heads of State and Government, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, I congratulate you on your election as President of the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly and convey our deep appreciation to your predecessor for  his able leadership during the preceding session. I wish also to congratulate Mr Antnio Guterres, on his re-appointment for a second term and for his leadership of the United Nations during these unprecedented times. As we approach the two-year mark since the first case of the COVID- virus was recorded, the world continues to struggle with the painful impact of this pandemic. The pandemic has claimed millions of lives, depleting economies, and shattering communities while disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable. The past two years have been a stark reminder that the global community has failed to adequately address some of the most pressing issues of our time: effective and equitable access to health-care, glaring inequalities, climate change and environmental degradation, the arms race, endless conflicts, the plight of refugees … to name but a few. And here we are, the leaders of the world, standing on this platform today to reflect on how to build back better, stronger and greener. As we enter the second year of the UN decade of action, it is imperative that we, as a community of nations, take deliberate, collaborative and decisive actions to guarantee a future that leaves no one behind. In recalling our commitments to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and related treaties, let us remind ourselves that the most vulnerable people – those living in  dire conditions and facing seemingly insurmountable crises – require special attention and help. Indeed, while the pandemic has brought about untold suffering, devastated global health systems, severely impacted the world economy and impoverished entire communities, the crisis at hand presents an opportunity to reinvigorate our collective will to bring about positive changes, with emphasis on equitable, sustainable, and inclusive governance.                       Our recovery depends on it. Central to global recovery is the availability and distribution of vaccines. Central to the health and well-being of every human being is solidarity. Statements, good  intentions and pledges are woefully inadequate. The facts speak for themselves. Of 554 million doses pledged by the world's richest nations, only  million, or %, have been delivered. In Africa, less than .% of people across the continent have been vaccinated against Covid-. The figure is far short of the African CDC’s official target of % of Africans. It is a disgrace! And it points to a sobering fact. There is a virus far more terrible, far more harrowing than COVID19. It is the virus of inequality! And while the pandemic rages on and the debate continues unabated, and travel advisories of all shades and hues are being issued, humanity is the first casualty. Especially Africa and many other less developed parts of the world. It is true that no one is safe until we are all  safe. COVAX, striving as it is against all odds, can fulfil its mandate only if pledges and commitments made by the richest nations are honoured and not used as short-term leverage in one form and another. Mr President, The world’s resilience to this pandemic, or to potential future ones, goes beyond the health of our people. Our efforts should also tackle economic imbalances and inequalities. In this regard, Seychelles urges the international community to assist the world’s most vulnerable economies in enhancing their resilience to future shocks. Seychelles’ economy, like that of many other Small Island Developing States (SIDS), was brought to its knees just a few months after the pandemic hit, as we witnessed the near total collapse of our tourism industry. For us, this meant forgoing some of our hard-earned economic gains in order to implement contingency plans, focused on protecting our population.  The devastating impact of the COVID- pandemic, as well as the inadequacies in responding to it, underscore the urgent need for stronger collective measures among member states of the United Nations. It is imperative that we work together to build consensus and cohesion in respect of the plight of those facing threats of an existential nature, most notably SIDS. Our vulnerabilities are well known and they need not be expounded on here. What needs to be stressed, however, is that a “one-size-fits-all” approach to debt relief and concessionary financial flows is                  certainly not the most appropriate for us. An approach and a strategy, which take into account our vulnerabilities and characteristics, would bolster our own efforts to weather the present crisis and to strengthen our capabilities to recover and rebound from the economic fallout caused by the pandemic. The application of the Vulnerability Index, therefore, remains for us, the only coherent and viable approach and strategy to resolving our current predicament. Most SIDS have achieved middle to high-income status through hard work and commitment for the betterment of our peoples, but it appears that we are being penalised for our  success, penalised for our achievements and hard work. Are the international financial institutions taking our vulnerabilities into consideration? The review of the criteria to measure development support and access to funding is still being debated incessantly in countless fora, with no end in sight. Lack of effective and appropriate global support for SIDS will have systemic consequences on our progress on practically all Sustainable Development Goals. Furthermore, SIDS continue to be disproportionately affected by what can be best termed as environmental injustice as a result of climate change. We are the least responsible for it, yet we pay the heaviest tribute. The challenge we face to climate change and our response to it will continue long after we have brought COVID- under control. We are morally obligated to those who have lost their lives to the calamitous climate and biodiversity crises. We are accountable to those who face constant existential threats. And we owe it to future generations to find lasting solutions to protect this planet. But despite the enormity of the peril that we face, I remain hopeful that together we will find solutions. It requires practical solutions from around the globe that would lead us towards a sustainable, greener  world powered by a clean energy economy. However, pledges and commitments are just not enough. They must be respected and honoured. In the light of the upcoming COP26, Seychelles calls on the international community, particularly the larger emitters and economies of the G20, to increase their  Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to a level that meets, if not surpasses the requirements of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report and averts the global catastrophe that threatens all of us. Mr President, The pandemic and worsening climate crisis have added to the other difficult tasks of the United Nations. We must more than ever renew our  commitment to multilateralism and reinforce the functions of United Nations. Let us be guided by the UN Charter as we move together to rebuild a greener world, leaving no one, particularly the most vulnerable, behind.                 I believe in the founding principles of the United Nations; that multilateralism is key to ensuring prosperity and lasting peace. Let us restore hope and belief in the UN, by restoring hope and  belief in ourselves and in international solidarity. Let us rebuild trust in one another by bridging the inequality gaps within and between nations, reducing marginalisation, eradicating racism, xenophobia and all other forms of discrimination, and instilling tolerance among our peoples. Never have we, as a community of nations, been beset with challenges of the present magnitude. But there is hope. Hope that we can overcome them.There is hope that we can overcome the challenges that we face through collective action, global solidarity and with political will. As the leader of one of the smallest nations of the world, I strongly believe in the capacity of our people, especially our youth. I believe, above all, in the capacity of humanity. I believe in our capacity to do good. Together, as the representatives of our planet we can do what is expected of us. We can do good! Thank you.         "

9,2021,SSD,South Sudan,"President At the 76th United Nations General Assembly   September , 2021 UN HQS, New York, New York Your Excellency, President of the General Assembly, Your Excellency, Secretary-General of the United Nations, Excellencies, Heads of Delegations and Fellow Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, Speech at the 76th Session UN-H.E. REBECCA de MABIOR, VICE PRESIDENT                 On behalf of President H.E. Salva Kiir Mayardit, I stand before you to share the recent developments in our country. I intend to do so in  the spirit of constructive engagement.  On  July  ,  2011,  we  emerged  from  a  long  liberation  struggle  against oppression and domination. Yet, less than three years later, the country collapsed  into  another  war  triggered  by  a  power  struggle  among  our leaders. That war was preceded by two agreements mediated by IGAD, the AU,  the  UN,  and  other  keys,  friendly  nations.  The  Agreement  created  a conducive  environment  that  enabled  the  formation  of  the  Transitional Government of National Unity in 2020.  Unfortunately,  our  determination  to  implement  the  Agreement  has  met many challenges, including the global Covid- pandemic outbreak and the limited resources needed for its implementation.  President  Salva  Kiir  launched  the  National  Dialogue  to  complement  the Agreement  while  the  revitalized  peace  process  was  underway.  The National Dialogue followed a bottom-up approach, conducting grassroots consultations  that  covered  all  the  regions  in  the  country.  The  President received the report of the National Dialogue in May 2021 and pledged to implement its recommendations.  Mr. President, Distinguished Delegates, The Revitalized Agreement and National Dialogue are necessary historical steps in our country's quest for peace. But we are still far from building a nation that can provide essential services and development for our people. I am not here to deny our past mistakes as national leaders. Nor do I intend Speech at the 76th Session UN-H.E. REBECCA de MABIOR, VICE PRESIDENT         to be defensive in response to our friends and the world's disappointment in us. Instead, I am here to participate in a constructive dialogue with our international partners. Permit me, therefore, to highlight a few points. First, I would like to acknowledge that although our independence was the product of the struggle and sacrifices of our people, we could not have won without  the  political  and  material  support  from  our  friends,  allies,  and partners from around the world. We are deeply grateful to them.  Second, I want to assure our friends and partners that we are determined to open a new page by committing ourselves never to go back to war. We pledge to pursue the promises our liberators made to our people. We must ensure  peace,  security,  and  dignity  for  all  without  distinction.  We  must replace the destruction of war with the productive use of our vast natural resources for the good of our people.  Third, we fully realize that the responsibility for pursuing this vision is our own as a people. We believe that the partnerships we seek can only be accomplished through constructive mutual engagements. Mr. President, Distinguished Delegates, The failure to fulfill the promises of our struggle is due to objective reasons for  which  our  partners  and  ourselves must cooperate  in finding  practical solutions. While there should be no doubt about the goodwill of President Salva Kiir and  the  government  he  leads  to  secure  peace  and  general  welfare,  we need  to  identify  and  address  the  objective  reasons  for  these  failures. Speech at the 76th Session UN-H.E. REBECCA de MABIOR, VICE PRESIDENT         President  Kiir  has  recently  stated  that  it  is  now  time  to  correct  the  past mistakes  and  open  a  new  page  for  building  a  better  future  of  peace, development, and prosperity for our people.  Mr. President, Distinguished Delegates, We should  recall that  at  our  independence, the  international  community pledged  to  help  build  the  capacity  of  our  infant  country  in  all  areas  of nation-building.  As  a  result,  the  United  Nations  Mission  in  South  Sudan (UNMISS) was created to help establish the foundations of our new nation.  However, after the outbreak of the war, that vision was abandoned, and priority  was  placed  on  protecting  civilians  and  providing  humanitarian assistance. As a result, support for capacity building was terminated. Of  course,  protecting  civilians  must  be  a  priority.  As  the  Vice  President responsible for the Humanitarian Cluster in our government, I fully endorse that priority. But it should not be at the expense of capacity building.  On the contrary, building capacities enables the state to govern responsibly and  effectively.  However,  we  must  also  guard  against  the  unintended consequence of dependency on humanitarian assistance.  It is a painful and shameful situation for a country endowed with vast fertile land  to  be  regarded  as  poor.  We  must  ensure  peace  and  security  in  the country  and  encourage  our  people  to  return  to  their  areas  of  origin  and cultivate.  I am glad to note that encouraging steps have recently been taken in this direction. For example, our security forces and their UNMISS counterparts Speech at the 76th Session UN-H.E. REBECCA de MABIOR, VICE PRESIDENT          have begun to promote rural peace and security. We also understand that UNMISS  is  planning  to  expand  its  mandate  to  include  feeder  roads construction.  The  government  welcomes  and  appreciates  such developments.  To fulfill the vision of our liberation struggle, we must use our oil revenues to fuel economic growth through investment in agriculture. We must invest in infrastructure to connect our rural communities to the markets. We need the public and private sectors, including foreign investors, to join hands in turning South Sudan's potential wealth into a reality.  The cooperation we desire with our international partners must be based on three fundamental principles that are outlined in the UNMISS mandate: ) Political strategies drive peace operations.  ) Partnerships are essential for success, and  ) People are at the center of peace operations.  Mr. President, Distinguished Delegates, Let's look at the implementation of the various chapters of the Agreement. First, we have formed Executive and Legislative organs at the national and state levels in line with the power-sharing formulas in Chapter One of the Agreement.  More  importantly,  we  have  made  significant  progress  in  implementing public financial management reforms in chapter four. These measures have met the expectations of international financial institutions and other external partners. In addition, the constitution-making process has recently taken a Speech at the 76th Session UN-H.E. REBECCA de MABIOR, VICE PRESIDENT        significant step forward with convening a workshop that charted a roadmap toward the drafting and adoption of the permanent constitution.  In chapter six, the The implementation of Chapter Five on transitional justice, accountability, reconciliation, and healing is moving forward at a relatively slow pace. This is not for lack of political will, but rather for objective reasons that we are addressing with our regional and international partners.  We can, therefore, say that the glass is half full in the implementation of most  chapters  of  the  Revitalized  Peace  Agreement.  Where  the  glass remains,  half-empty  is  in  Chapter  Two  on  a  permanent  ceasefire  and transitional  security  arrangements.  There  is  an  urgent  need  to  form  a unified professional army under one command and control. The security sector reform is the most challenging part of the Agreement as it contains elements at the center of the violent conflicts in the country.  The  parties  to  the  Agreement  and  other  stakeholders  should  continue dialogue  to  build  the  mutual  understanding  and  confidence  needed  to address and resolve longstanding differences. Building sustainable peace requires  inclusivity,  collective  investment,  determination,  diligence,  and patience. Mr. President Having  celebrated  the  10th  anniversary  of  Independent  this  year,  the  next decade, the United Nations Decade of Action to deliver on the SDGs by 2030 is an opportune moment that coincides with our efforts to develop the country's economy by investing in agriculture. Moreover, with the youth estimated at . Speech at the 76th Session UN-H.E. REBECCA de MABIOR, VICE PRESIDENT       percent  of  the  population,  the  government  promises  to  leverage  women  and young people's contribution to agriculture and economic development.  Distinguished ladies and gentlemen Climate change has already impacted the lives of some 800 000 people across South Sudan. In addition, torrential rains have resulted in worse flooding in  years and have submerged villages, towns, land, and life stocks. Therefore, I call  on  the  international  community  to  help  save  the  lives  of  more  than  . million people in need of a humanitarian assistant.  Mr. President, Distinguished Delegates I am happy to report that the bilateral relationship between South Sudan and Sudan has significantly improved. We have cooperated effectively to resolve our internal problems, positively reinforcing our mutual relationship.  There are,  however,  issues  that  still  need  to  be  resolved  between  our  two countries.  First and foremost is the  issue of the  contested  area  of  Abyei. The Abyei protocol of the CPA clearly states the basis for resolving  this issue.  Unfortunately, since then, we have disagreed on implementing the Abyei Protocol  and  have entered  into several  additional  agreements without a final solution. Now, Khartoum has called for the withdrawal of the Ethiopian forces  in  the  United  Nations  Interim  Security  Force  in  Abyei.  Any alternative  arrangements  will  take  time  and  leave  a  dangerous  security gap in the area.  Speech at the 76th Session UN-H.E. REBECCA de MABIOR, VICE PRESIDENT        This issue can be resolved peacefully through an arrangement that will give Abyei people their freedom and dignity. Moreover, that will enable them to play a positive role at the border between the two Sudan’s. We are determined to learn from the past and look forward to engaging in a constructive dialogue, revitalize cooperation, and being more effective in pursuing our shared objectives. We must make the Revitalized  Peace  Agreement succeed,  and we  can only  do  that  with  the  support  of  our  regional  and  international  partners. Simply stated, South Sudan desires and is ready to turn a new page.  Mr. President, Distinguished Delegates I  have  come  to  this  assembly  with  the  spirit  of  my  late  husband,  Dr.  John Garang de Mabior, and all those who paid the ultimate price in the struggle. It  was  a  dream  for  Dr.  John  to  liberate  his  people  and  address  the  global community at this very podium. But being here as a female Vice President from an independent South Sudan realizes Dr. John's dream.  Thank you, Mr. President and Distinguished Delegates, for your attention. Speech at the 76th Session UN-H.E. REBECCA de MABIOR, VICE PRESIDENT              "
10,2021,UGA,Uganda,"President of the UN General Assembly; Excellencies, Heads of State and Government; Secretary-General of United Nations; Distinguished delegates; Ladies and Gentlemen. Mr. President,  I congratulate you on your election as President of the 76th Session of the UN General Assembly and assure you of Uganda’s unwavering support. I commend H.E. Mr. Volkan Bozkir for his transformational leadership  of  the  75th  Session,  especially  during  such  challenging times of the COVID- pandemic.  I would also like to congratulate the Secretary-General, H.E. Antnio Guterres,  upon  his  re-appointment  for  the  second  term  and  thank him  for  his  devotion  to  the  work  of  the  United  Nations.  Your  re-election  is  a  demonstration  of  the  confidence  that  member  states have  in  your  leadership.  I  commiserate  with  all  countries  on  the enormous lives lost due to the COVID- pandemic.  Uganda  welcomes  the  theme  of  the  76th  Session  of  the  General Assembly. The United Nations is the appropriate forum to speak with a common voice on sustainable, resilient and inclusive recovery from the devastating impacts of the COVID- pandemic. This Session is a timely reminder of the urgent need for effective multilateral action to accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable to  realize  our  vision,  shared  principles  and Development commitments, to end poverty in  all its dimensions and ensure “no one  is  left  behind.""    As  we  celebrate  the  76th  anniversary  of  the United Nations, it requires a revitalized United Nations that is fit for addressing  global  challenges  that  face  us  today.  In  this  regard, Uganda reiterates its commitment to multilateralism. We believe that by working together, we can better respond to global crises such as the COVID- pandemic and climate change and their consequences.         Mr. President, Uganda, like  other  countries,  has  had  to  respond  to  the unprecedented and multi-faceted effects of the COVID- pandemic. Uganda’s  approach  has  been  to  prioritize  the  protection  of  human life.    To  ensure  a  sustainable,  resilient  and  inclusive  recovery,  the Government has taken deliberate and targeted decisions to continue strengthening the capacities of the national health system and other key sectors of the economy to respond to the impacts of the COVID- pandemic adequately.  However, the COVID- pandemic and its consequences can only be effectively  responded  to  if  we  act  collectively.  In  this  regard,  we appreciate the efforts of some individual states, various international and regional organisations, particularly the United Nations, African Union,  European  Union,  G20,  World  Health  Organisation, International  Monetary  Fund,  World  Bank  Group  and  others,  in supporting  Countries  to  respond  to  the  pandemic.        We  see vaccination of all as the best way to address the pandemic.  We now know that restricting the ability to get vaccines affects the ability to control the pandemic and prevents new variants from emerging.  Therefore, we call for more action to ensure that at the centre of a global  recovery,  equitable,  affordable  access  for  all  to  safe,  quality, efficacious,  effective,  accessible  and  affordable  COVID-  vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics.  We commend the Secretary General’s efforts  for  his  continued  advocacy  and  active  engagement  on equitable access to vaccines.   On the other side, we find that the actions by some to hold vaccines at  the  expense  of  poor  Countries,  also  referred  to  as  vaccine nationalism, is wrong, but a good lesson for developing Countries that don’t want to innovate.   It is good because it wakes up those that are asleep, waiting to be saved by others.       Uganda is progressing in searching for cures and vaccines, which will be achieved in a few years.   We are developing a vaccine with our own funding and the help that we need is for raw materials for the vaccines. Therefore, we invite interested partners to support us with the raw materials. Mr. President, Uganda reaffirms her commitment to implementing the 2030 Agenda for  Sustainable  Development  in  its  entirety  and  to  achieving   Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as we commence the decade of action and delivery of Sustainable Development. We have realized now  more  than  ever,  the  urgent  need  to  accelerate  our  progress towards  the  implementation  of  the  2030  Agenda  as  a  pillar  in  our national  response  to  the  multi-faceted  impacts  of  the  COVID- pandemic  as  we  build  back  better  and  strive  to  achieve  the overarching 2030 Agenda goal of eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions.  The COVID-  reinforces the pre-existing obstacles to realizing the Goals, structural inequalities, gaps, systematic challenges and risks. We  firmly  believe  that  the  successful  implementation  of  our  Third National Development Plan (NDP III) under the theme “Sustainable industrialization for inclusive growth, employment and wealth creation” is critical in achieving  SDGs.  Uganda  has  implemented  an  inclusive  process  to  ensure  that  the people own the SDG agenda, starting with the national coordination arrangements. As a result, the Government fully mainstreamed the Industry, SDGs, Governance  and  Environment,  based  on  their  relative  return  on investment.  identifying  key  accelerators, instance, for As Uganda advances the implementation of its plans, it is committed to ensuring no one is left behind. The Government has put in place        laws and policies to support the inclusion of vulnerable persons. For instance, the Public Finance Management Act (2017) ensures gender and  equity  responsive  budgeting.  In  addition,  the  Government increased  funding  to  livelihood  and  special  grants  for  youth  and women.  Now with the new Parish Development Model, which started in the financial year 2020/, the SDGs will be much more localized, monitored and reported on up to the lowest level, thus ""Leaving No One  Behind.""    The  Social  Assistance  Grant  for  Empowerment reduced program  has  also vulnerabilities for older persons aged  years.  improved  social  security  and The COVID- pandemic has disrupted Uganda’s progress in some sectors but has also given impetus to the Country’s industrialization drive. The toll that the pandemic has had on jobs, hitherto promising sectors  could  significantly impact  efforts  to  reduce  poverty, vulnerability and inequality. However, it has awakened the discourse on how Uganda builds its systems to generate the required resilience to withstand such shocks. As the Government fast-tracks progress on the 2030 Agenda, it has embraced the global wave of digital transformation, which presents significant  opportunities.  However,  whereas  the  2030  Agenda  is strongly  anchored  on  environmental  integrity  and  sustainability, there  are  increasing  effects  of  climate  change  reducing  Uganda’s natural capital. Therefore, the 3rd National development Plan sets out ambitious climate actions through the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan. Mr. President, Setting our path towards the full realization of the 2030 Agenda and the  Paris  Agreement  requires  that  we  urgently  address  climate change, one of the greatest challenges to humanity. We continue to witness  the  enormous  loss  of  lives  and  property  due  to  climate       change-related disasters globally. All of us are susceptible to these climate change disasters. We, therefore, stress the need to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change in the context of sustainable  development  and  efforts  to  eradicate  poverty  through bold  multilateral  actions  by  all.  Uganda  continues  to  experience prolonged droughts, melting of ice caps at its highest mountain, Mt. Ruwenzori, floods, erratic rainfall and landslides.  Recently,  Uganda  experienced  impacts  of  intensive  and  prolonged droughts  and  rainfall,  severely  impacting  lives  and  livelihoods.  We share  Lake  Victoria,  The  second  largest  freshwater  lake,  with  the brotherly Countries of Kenya and Tanzania.    The lake's water level in Uganda is measured at a place in the city of Jinja and the lowest level of water ever recorded was in 1923, when it was .28metres.   Before  that,  the  highest  level  recorded  had  been  on  January    in 1918; the record showed .89metres and the subsequent high-level record  was  on  May  ,  1964,  when  the  water  level  reached  . metres.   However, since last year, the water level in the lake has been going up.  On May , 2020, the water level reached the new record level of .49metres.  Since that time, the water level has remained above  meters. Therefore, we have asked the people who settled too close to the Lakeshores to move away from the Lake Shores. Staying 200 meters from the Lakeshore is the wise, correct and useful thing to do.  Uganda, despite being a less contributor to climate change, is taking deliberate  and  targeted  actions  to  address  climate  change  through investments in climate adaptation and mitigation measures such as increasing  access  and  consumption  of  clean  energy  to  enhance production, and increasing forest and wetland cover, among others in  line  with  our  ambitious  Nationally,  Determined  Contributions. However, mobilization of means of implementation for climate change remains crucial as urgent action is required to significantly reduce      emissions,  adapt  to  the  adverse  effects  and  reduce  the  impacts  of climate change.  We commend the Green Climate Fund for its commitment to a : balance between mitigation and adaptation in its portfolio and ensure that  at  least  %  of  adaptation  funding  goes  to  particularly vulnerable countries, including LDCs, SIDS (Small Island Developing States)  and  African  States.  In  this  context,  Uganda  reiterates  its commitment to support bold action proposals at the 26th Session of the  Conference  of  the  Parties  to  the  UN  Framework  Convention on Climate Change scheduled in the United Kingdom from November -,  2021,  in  the  areas  of  mitigation,  adaptation  and  finance.  We, therefore,  call  on  the  developed  Countries  to  fulfill  their  financial commitment in line with the Paris Agreement to provide 100 billion US  Dollars  annually  by  2020  to  assist  developing  Country  Parties with  respect  to  both  mitigation  and  adaptation  with  a  concrete roadmap.  As  we  concluded  the  UN  Decade  on  Biodiversity  2011-2020,  the assessment  on  the  progress  towards  the  global  biodiversity  targets indicated  insufficient  results.  Uganda,  just  like  most  Countries, continues  to  experience  biodiversity  loss  to  the  extent  that  some wildlife  and  other  living  species  are  now  in  danger  of  extinction. Cognizant of this urgency, Uganda with support of the international community,  has  taken  specific  bold  action  measures  that  include inter alia: mainstreaming of biodiversity conservation and restoration in our national development policies and priorities as highlighted in our National Development Plan 111 for Financial Years 2020/2021-2024/2025  and  Vision  2040;  restoration  of  ,000  hectares  of degraded wetlands to benefit  million farmers with a target regaining our  1994  of  .%  wetland  coverage  by  2030;  re-afforestation  and afforestation of over 200,000 hectares and we have prioritized more tree planting to ensure that Uganda’s forest coverage increases from .%  in  2015  to  %  by  2030;  strengthening  the  public-private sector and non-state actors’ engagement; demarcation of boundaries     forest  reserves  to  prevent of  critical  wetlands  and  central encroachment; strengthening the legal and institutional framework to address the challenge of illegal wildlife trade and poaching such as repealing  the  Wild  life  Act  Chapter.  200  in  2019  with  the  Uganda Wildlife Act, 2019, that provides for the conservation and sustainable management  of  wildlife  and;  enforcement  of  fishing  regulations  to address the challenge of illegal and unregulated fishing. Uganda has acted  decisively  to  fulfill  the  commitment  made  during  the celebrations  of  the  70th  anniversary  of  the  United  Nations  in September, 2015 to protect the planet from degradation. Mr. President, implementation  of  the  2030  Agenda Countries  in  the  global  south  have  continued  to  stand  in solidarity with their global counterparts even during the COVID-  pandemic  by  offering  appropriate  support  to  enable  them adequately  respond  to  the  pandemic.  Their  actions  are  in  line with  the  principles  of  South-South  Cooperation  and  support  of the for  Sustainable Development. In this regard, Uganda will continue to strengthen South-South  and  Triangular  Cooperation  within  the  United Nations.  As  the  Third  South  Summit  host,  I  reiterate  Uganda’s commitment to host the Summit and look forward to welcoming my fellow G77/China leaders to Kampala, Uganda, on suitable dates in 2022/.     Mr. President, The predicament of Countries in special situations particularly, the Least Developed Countries (LDCs), continues to-date. The evidence (IPoA) from implementation  overall  assessment  indicates  insufficient  progress Istanbul  Programme  of  Action for  LDCs the       towards achieving its overarching goal of half of the LDCs graduating by  2020.  Uganda,  like  other  Least  Developed  Countries,  has continued to face numerous challenges during IPoA implementation that  include,  among  other  things:  limited  productive  capacities, limited funding, insufficient physical infrastructure, commodity price loss  and  disasters. volatility,  climate  change,  biodiversity Notwithstanding the structural constraints to development faced by LDCs, Uganda has registered progress in implementing the Istanbul Programme  of  Action,  in  particular,  national  paved  road  network increased; accessibility to electricity and innovations as well as the use  of  mobile  technology  for  financial  transactions  increased.  In addition,  primary  school  enrollment  (including  gender  parity  in primary  education)  increased;  maternal  and  infant  mortality  rates decreased and prevalence and incidence rates of HIV/AIDS reduced.  We should, therefore, during the Fifth UN Conference on the Least Developed  Countries,  agree  on  the  next  Programme  of  Action  that calls  for  a  more  enhanced,  renewed  and  strengthened  global partnership to support graduation and smooth transition of LDCs as agreed upon at major UN Conferences and Summits. In our view, this Programme  should  contain  robust  means  of  implementation  to support  the  LDCs  inadequately  addressing  the  existing  structural constraints,  particularly  limited  productive  capacities,  inadequate funding,  high  debt  level,  commodity  price  volatility,  as  well  as emerging  challenges  like  climate  change,  biodiversity  loss  and disasters. In addition, the Programme should contain a robust follow-up and monitoring framework at all levels to track its timely and full implementation.  Mr. President, Terrorism continues to constitute one of the most serious threats to international  peace  and  security.  Terrorism  and  violent  extremism continue  to  bring  death  and  suffering  to  innocent  people.  Terrorist groups such as Daesh, Al-Qaida, Al-Shabaab, Boko Haram and the      Allied  Democratic  Forces  (ADF)  continue  to  inflict  death  and devastation.  The  international  community  must  adapt  to  this changing landscape. We must be unwavering in our resolve to combat terrorism  and  Uganda,  will  continue  to  support  and  actively participate in global and regional counter-terrorism efforts.     Mr. President, Our  development  and  transformation  cannot  take  place  without peace  and  security  –  these  are  prerequisites  for  socio-economic transformation. We should continue to give attention to supporting a peaceful environment, thus enabling us to concentrate on our growth and  development.    The  UN  should  continue  to  support  conflict prevention  and  resolution  initiatives  undertaken  by  regional  and sub-regional  organizations (AU)  and Intergovernmental  Authority  on  Development (IGAD).  This partnership  should  be  based  on  the  division  of  labour  and burden sharing, complementarity and mutual respect.  We should continue to encourage and strengthen this partnership.  like  the  African  Union We continue to face serious challenges to peace and security in our region; Uganda continues to support and advance peace and security efforts  in  the  region.  We  remain  actively  involved  in  regional initiatives  such  as  those  of  the  AU,  IGAD,  EAC,  ICGLR  and  are encouraged  by  the  progress  that  we  continue  to  make.  Uganda  is committed to continuing working with our international partners in supporting the counter-terrorism and stabilization efforts in Somalia, the political transition in Sudan, implementation  of the Revitalized Peace Agreement in South Sudan and the elimination of terrorist and other negative forces in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Mr. President,        This Assembly made a historic pledge during the World Summit held in 2005. A commitment to strengthening the United Nations with a view to enhancing its authority and efficiency. This cannot happen without the reform of the UN Security Council. The need to reform the UN Security Council is now more urgent and imperative than ever before.  Uganda  supports  the  comprehensive  reform  of  the  UN Security Council.  The present geopolitical realities are compelling for a  comprehensive  reform  of  the  Security  Council  to  make  way  for equitable representation.  Africa, with more than one billion citizens and over seventy percent of  issues  on  the  agenda  of  the  Council,  continues  to  suffer  the historical  injustice  of  having  no  representation  at  all  in  the Permanent  category  of  the  Security  Council  and  being  under-represented  in  the  non-Permanent  category.    It  is  time  that  we address  this  long-standing  injustice  and  imbalance  perpetuated  in the present configuration of the Security Council without any further delay. The  Common  African  Position  on  the  reform  of  the  UN  Security Council,  as  enunciated  in  the  Ezulwini  Consensus  and  Sirte Declaration,  continues  to  garner  wide  support  of  the  UN membership.  Therefore,  it  is  imperative  that  Member  states expeditiously work towards achieving progress in the negotiations on reform in the context of the Intergovernmental Negotiations (IGN) so that Africa can assume its rightful place in the Security Council. Mr. President, All countries are duty-bound to promote and protect human rights under international law and the United Nations Charter. Therefore, we must continue to address the promotion and protection of human rights without politicizing the issue of human rights. Uganda remains committed to fulfilling its human rights obligation in accordance with its constitution and international law. Our commitment is from the       firm  belief  that  it  is  suitable  for  our  people,  drawn  from  the  bad experience  and  lessons  from  our  history  of  dictatorship.    In  this context, Uganda will be voluntarily reviewed during the 40th Session of the Universal Periodic Review at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, scheduled from January to February 2022. Mr. President, The  predicament  of  refugees  continues  to  this  day.    Uganda  has maintained  its  open-door  policy  on  refugees  and  currently,  the country hosts over . million refugees, the largest number in Africa.  It is in line with this spirit, that recently we took another deliberate step  to  assist  those  in  distress  from  Afghanistan.  Our  approach  to refugees is anchored in our belief that no one chooses to flee their country  or  be  a  refugee  and  if  they  do,  they  must  be  treated  with dignity and kindness in their times of need.     However,  the  circumstances  of  the  refugees  and  host  communities pose enormous challenges for the national authorities, which need to be  addressed  as  part  of  international  solidarity.        We,  therefore, continue  to  call  for  more  equitable  sharing  of  the  burden  and responsibility  for  hosting  and  supporting  the  world’s  refugees consistent with international commitments.   I thank you for your attention.        "
11,2021,TZA,United Republic of Tanzania,"President  of  the  General Assembly; Your  Excellency  Antnio  Gutteres,  Secretary  General  of  the United Nations; Excellencies Heads of State and Government; Distinguished Delegates,  Ladies and Gentlemen.         Let me commence by joining previous speakers in applauding you,  Mr.  President,  for  being  elected  to  preside  over  the  76th Session of this august Assembly and for the exemplary manner in  which  you  have  been  presiding  over  this  Session.  I  also commend you for the ably manner in which you mastered to make possible for us to meet physically despite unprecedented circumstances brought by the COVID- pandemic. The holding of a physical general debate this year albeit with some  limitations,  demonstrates  again  that  humanity  and multilateralism  cannot  and  should  not  succumb  to  the  virus. And thus where there is a will, there is always a way.       This spirit is what we need going forward. It is why I support and subscribe to the theme of this 76th session that call all of us to “build resilience through hope to recover from COVID , rebuild  sustainability,  respond  to  the  needs  of  the  planet, respect  the  lives  of  people,  and  revitalize  the  United Nations”.  Mr. President, As  this  is  my  maiden  speech  at  the  United  Nations  General Assembly,  Allow  me  on  behalf  of  the  people  and  the Government  of  the  United  Republic  of  Tanzania,  to  thank  all members of the United Nations for your condolence messages extended to our nation following the untimely passing  of our     late President, Dr. John Pombe Joseph Magufuli, on  March, 2021. May his soul continue to rest in eternal peace.  We remain indebted to you for the thoughtful and comforting messages which helped us to prevail over that unprecedented test  to  our  nationhood.  It  is  in  the  same  vein  that  I  thank  the outgoing President of the 75th Session for dedicating a slot on the  59th  Plenary meeting  of  the  General  Assembly,  on  the  16th of  April  2021  to  pay  tribute  to  our  beloved  late  President  Dr. Magufuli.  Indeed  this  was  a  gesture  of  solidarity  and brotherhood.        Mr. President,  It is not by sheer coincidence that I chose to attend the United Nations General Assembly as my first trip outside Africa, since I  took  the  office. I  did  so,  out  of  my  deep  sense  of  conviction and faith in multilateralism in solving multitude of challenges that our world face today. I am here to assure you that under my stewardship Tanzania will remain a formidable member of the United Nations and a dependable  supporter  of  multilateralism.  We  will  keep  our arms  open  to  those  who  embrace  us  and  engage  with us.  We will  continue  to  be  the  Tanzania  that  you  have  known  and relied  on.  A  Tanzania  that  peacefully  and  respectfully  co-existed and cooperated with all countries, big or small, mighty     or weak, rich, or poor, to make this world, our world, a better place for all of us.  Mr. President,  COVID- pandemic has reminded us how vulnerable we are as  individual  countries  regardless  of  our  size,  wealth,  or geography. As we meet here today, we have less than a decade ahead  to  meet  our  collective  commitment  to  achieve  the Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs).  I  note  with  great regret  that  according  to  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals Report 2020, right now, the world is not on track to achieve the 2030 Agenda mainly due to the adverse impact of COVID-.  The  Report  further  shows  that  in  some  areas,  this  pandemic has  even  reversed  the  progress  that  was  already  achieved     years back. For instance, it is expected that around  million people  who  got  out  of  extreme  poverty  will  be  pushed  back into  that  situation  because  of  this  pandemic.  What is depressing  is  the  fact  that  these  impacts  are  not  felt  evenly. We,  in  the  developing  world  are  the  most  affected.  It  is therefore  imperative  that  concerted  efforts  are  undertaken  to address this devastating situation.  Mr. President, Developing  nations  must  be  assisted  in  addressing  socio-economic  impact  of  the  COVID-.  On  this  note,  we  are thankful to  multilateral financial institutions like the International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  for  their  efforts  in  saving many economies from collapsing. These kinds of interventions     are important. We cannot afford to take refuge on the onset of COVID- as an excuse for  not making sufficient progress on achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Mr. President, Tanzania has not been spared by COVID-. After the onset of the  pandemic,  we  in  Tanzania,  and  I  believe  in  many  other developing  countries,  were  stuck  in  the  twilight  of protecting lives  and  protecting  livelihoods.  Measures  advocated  by  the World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  were  geared  towards protecting  lives.  However,  in  an  economy  like  Tanzania’s consisting  of  a  big  proportion  of  people  living  on  subsistence economy,  whom  we  need  to  keep  them  afloat,  my  country      therefore adopted all necessary measures to curb the spread of COVID-,  including  joining  the  COVAX  facility,  to  ensure that Tanzanians gain access to the COVID- vaccine.  The vaccination campaign has started in July this year with the most  vulnerable  communities  and later  on  other  age groupings. Mr. President, Globally,  when  COVID-  vaccines  were  being  developed, some  of  us  were  hopeful  that  this  would  mean  something good to all of humanity. Nevertheless, we have come to learn that, the virus is moving faster than the global production and distribution  of  vaccines,  as  the  vast  majority  of  vaccines  have      been  administered in  high  and  upper-middle-income countries.  With  the  current  pace,  it  is  less  likely  that  we  will meet the WHO’s threshold of vaccinating at least  percent of people  in  every  country  by  the  end  of  2021,  and  at  least   percent by the first half of 2022.  The level of vaccine inequity that we see is appalling. It is truly disheartening  to  see  that  whilst  most  of  our  countries  have inoculated  less  than  %  of  our  populace  and  thus,  seek  for more vaccines for our people, other countries are about to roll out  the  third  dose,  calling  it  “booster  vaccine”.  We  tend  to forget  that  nobody  is  safe  until  everyone  is  safe.  It  is indispensable  that  countries  with  surplus  COVID-  vaccine doses  share  them  with  other  countries.  On  another  note,  it  is     our  humble  request  that  patent  rights  on  COVID-  vaccines should  be  waived  for  developing  countries  so  that  they  can afford  to  produce  the  vaccines.  This  is  not  only  a  necessary move  to  end  this  pandemic  but  also  the  right  thing  to  do  in order to save humanity. Mr. President, On  economic  fronts,  the  United  Republic  of  Tanzania  like other  countries  has  not  been  spared  by  the  effects  of  the COVID-. Before the pandemic, our economy was growing at the steady rate of . percent compared to current growth rate estimated at  . percent.  We are now embarking on reviving the tourism sector which was badly affected  because of travel     restrictions put in many countries as means to curb the spread of COVID-.  While  slowly  trying  to  revive  most  of  economic  activities suffocated  by  the  pandemic,  the  Government  continues  to work  hard  to  improve  the  business  environment  and  attract more  investment.  Aware  of  the  nexus  between  economic growth  and  governance,  we  managed  to  maintain  peace  and political stability,  with a  vibrant  democracy and institutionalized good governance practises, upholding rule of law and human rights.        Mr. President, I wish to take note of the Secretary General’s Report on “Our Common  Agenda”  which  raises  key  issue  of  our  common concern  such  as  gender  equality,  climate  change  and  youth development.  On  gender  equality,  COVID-  is  threatening  to  roll  back  the gains  that  we  have made.  As  the  first  female  President  in  the history  of  my  country,  the  burden  of  expectation  to  deliver gender equality is heavier on my shoulder.  It is for this reasons that I commend the initiative by the UN-Women,  France,  and  Mexico  to  organize  the  Generation Equality  Forum  that  took  place  in  Paris  in  June  this  year,      whereby  my  country  volunteered  to  champion  for  Women’s Economic Rights and Justice. Aware  that  being  passionate  about  gender  equality  is  not sufficient,  my  government  is  reviewing  policy  and  legal frameworks  in  order  to  come  up  with  actionable  and measurable  plans  to  ensure  economic  empowerment  of women  but  also  other  aspects  pertaining  to  gender  equality and gender parity.  We are also working on designing an implementation gender-responsive  macro-economic  plans,  budget  reforms  and stimulus  packages  with  the  objective  of  reducing  the  number of women and girls’ living in poverty.        Mr. President,  The  challenges  of  climate  change  are  really  affecting livelihoods,  peace  and  security  and  forceful  displacement  of our  people.  Tanzania  government  spends    to    percent  of GDP to mitigate and build resilience of communities, and this is  a  lot  in  a  country  which  is  still  grappling  with  poverty coupled  with  emergency  of  the  COVID19  pandemic.  The pandemic  has  compromised  our  capacity  to  respond  to harmful impact of climate change. Therefore, our actions today determine the future of our planet in terms of climate change. In  this  regard,  I  call  for  transparent  modality  for  financial disbursement and emphasize that developed countries should fulfill their commitment to contribute USD 100 billion annually     by  2025  so  as  to  facilitate  the  implementation  of  the  Paris Agreement.    Mr. President, In  concluding  my  remarks,  I  wish  to  echo  my  country’s commitment  in  pursuing  the  principles  of  multilateralism  as enshrined  in  the  Charter  of  the  United  Nations.  I  urge  other nations  to  continue  supporting  this  august  institution.  The onset of COVID- has given to all of us a lesson that we are deeply  intertwined,  and  that  unilateralism  will  not  get  us anywhere  when  it  comes  to  challenges  that  transcends  our national borders.       A wise person once said, and I quote, “Alone, one will go fast, but  together  we  will  go  far”.  Multilateralism  must  always prevail! I thank you all for your kind attention!     "
12,2021,ZWE,Zimbabwe,"President of the 76th Session of the General Assembly; Your  Excellency  Antonio  Guterres,  Secretary General of the United Nations; Majesties; Excellencies, Heads of State and Government; Ladies and Gentlemen. Allow  me,  Your  Excellency,  to  extend  my  heartfelt congratulations to you on your election as President of the 76th  Session  of  the  General  Assembly.  We  are  confident that  your  vast  experience  will  help  advance the implementation of the global agenda during this Session.  I  also  pay  tribute  to  the  outgoing  President,  Mr.  Volkan Bozkir,  for  providing  outstanding  leadership  during  the 75th  Session,  at  a  time  when  the  COVID-  pandemic negatively impacted the work of our Organization.            Allow  me,  Mr.  President,  to  congratulate  the  United Nations  Secretary  General,  Mr.  Antnio  Guterres, on  his election for a second term. My country’s stands ready to work  closely  with  him  and  other  Member  States  to achieve our shared goal of a better life for all. The  Seventy  Sixth  Session  in  convening  against  the backdrop of the persistent COVID  pandemic. However all  hope  is  not  lost.  Drawing  from  the  collective milestones achieved to date, enhanced multilateralism and unity  of  purpose  remain  critical  in  mitigating  this  global health  emergency.  The  hoarding  and inequitable distribution with the resultant uneven vaccination patterns across the globe is not acceptable.  Vaccine nationalism is self-defeating  and  contrary  to  the  mantra  that  ‘no  one  is safe until everyone is safe. Whether in the global North or South, rich or poor, old or young, all people of the world deserve access to vaccines.       The pandemic has demonstrated the urgent need to build resilient  economies and  societies  that are  able  to  cope  in times  of  shocks  and  hazards.  The  pandemic  has necessitated  the  need  for  us  to  build  back  better  and greener, to emerge stronger.  The  theme  for  the  Seventy  Sixth  Session:  “Building Resilience Through Hope - to Recover from COVID-, Rebuild  Sustainably,  Respond  to  the  Needs  of  the Planet,  Respect  the  Rights  of  People  and  Revitalize  the United  Nations”,  resonates  well  with  the  needs  of  the world  at  this  juncture.  Together  we  can  indeed  conquer the  challenges  facing  humanity  and  realize  a  sustainable future that leaves no one behind. We  must  restore  dignity  and  hope,  particularly  for  our women,  youth  and  the  vulnerable,  who  look  to  us  for inspiration and assurance that their well-being and future remains at the core of all our endeavours.       Mr President;  This year’s high-level meetings mark important dialogues at  the  heart  of  sustainable  development  in  its  three dimensions.  The  Biodiversity  Summit  and  the  Second Global  Sustainable  Transport  Conference,  as  well  as  the Nutrition  for  Growth  Summit,  all  lined-up  this  year, complement our efforts towards a healthy planet.  Green energy is an enabler for building back better and is crucial in the direct achievement of SDGs, while playing a  key  role  in  mitigating  climate  change.  The  High-Level Dialogue on Energy Dialogue on energy sets the stage for exploring  viable  renewable  and  green  energy  solutions.  As  we  do  so,  let  us  link  economic  growth  with  the accelerated  transition  to  net-zero  emission  for  a  climate-resilient future. My  country  and  parts  of  the  Southern  African  region continue to experience the devastating impacts of climate change,  ranging  from  cyclone-induced  floods,  recurrent     droughts  and  shorter  rain  seasons,  hotter  summers  and colder  winters.  This  is  in  spite  of  the  fact  that  our Continent is the least polluter.  COP26 in Glasgow must therefore be about action and the fulfillment  of  decisions  of  the  past.  In  addition,  concrete financial  support  is  essential  to  combat  climate  change beyond  mere  rhetoric.    The  2030  Agenda  remains  our shared roadmap to achieve the future we all want.  For us in Zimbabwe, eradicating poverty and eliminating hunger  remain  a  top  priority.  Climate  change  and resultant  erratic  weather  patterns,  growing  populations, coupled with the effects of the pandemic on food supply chains,  demand  a  shift  from  our traditional  food production,  processing,  distribution  and  consumption systems.       My  Government  has  established  a  firm  foundation  for sustained food production through the land  redistribution programme  as  well  as  increased  support  for  communal and  small-holder  farmers.  This  has  led  to  broader  and sustainable  incomes  for  the  majority  of  people  living  in rural areas who now contribute to the increased levels of household and national food and nutrition security. The  United  Nations  Food  Systems  Summit  provides  a  welcome  platform  for  new  actions,  innovative  solutions and  plans  to deliver progress  across  all of  the  SDGs  and the Paris Agreement.  Mr. President, Zimbabwe launched Vision 2030, aimed at improving the lives  of  our  people, sustainably  managing the environment  and  ensuring  that  no  one  is  left  behind.     The pursuit of this inclusive and transformative vision has     seen  the  creation  of  more  decent  jobs,  reduction  of inequalities and access to quality social services.  Expanded new economic opportunities for all citizens are yielding positive results across all sectors of the economy.  The  multi-pronged  reforms  we  are  undertaking  has  seen us  being  one  of  the  fastest  movers  in  the  World  Bank Ease of Doing Business Index.   Zimbabwe  presented  the  second  Voluntary  National Review during the July 2021 High Level Political Forum Remarkable  progress  has  been registered towards universal health coverage and the creation                        of  a  competence  based  education  system  which  vaults innovation  for  a  knowledge  driven  economy.      Higher agriculture production and productivity, through improved  land  and  water  utilization  as  well  as  the adoption of climate smart agriculture is being promoted.       The  Voluntary  National  Review  further  highlighted progress  made  in  supporting  productive  employment, decent work and the formalization of the informal sector.  My  administration  continues  to  entrench  democracy constitutionalism  and  the  rule  of  law  through  sound  legislation  as well  as  fair  and  impartial  administration of justice.    This  is  indicative  of  our  strides  to  achieve sustainable development by 2030. We remain available to share experiences for mutual benefit.  My  Government recognizes and applauds the complementary  role  that  the  private  sector,  development partners, civil society organizations and other stakeholders in the realisation of SDGs in Zimbabwe.  In  speaking  of  challenges  faced  in  achieving  SDGs  the  COVID-  pandemic  has  increased  the  vulnerability    of our  economy  which  is  already  crippled  by  the  adverse effects  of  unilateral  illegal  sanctions  imposed  on  my     country.  This  has  further  worsened  our  capacity  to respond to the pandemic for the good of our citizens.   I  am  pleased  to  highlight  that  my  Government  has approved  the  visit  to  Zimbabwe  by  the  UN  Special Rapporteur  on  the  Negative  Impact  of  the  Unilateral Coercive Measures on the Enjoyment of Human Rights in  October 2021. This will afford the Special Rapporteur an opportunity to witness firsthand, the devastating impact of these illegal sanctions on my country.   We reiterate our call for the urgent unconditional removal of these illegal sanctions.  Zimbabwe  remains  grateful  to  the  SADC  region,  the African  Union  and  other  progressive  nations  who continue to stand with us and add their voices to the call for  the  unconditional  removal  of  these  unwarranted  and unjustified illegal  sanctions.  We  are  committed to engagement,  re-engagement  and  peaceful  co-existence and to be a friend to all and an enemy to none as we build     equal partnership for win-win cooperation and a common future.   Mr President;  The  state  of  global  peace  and  security  is  a  cause  for concern.  Terrorism,  illicit  flow  of  small  arms  and  light weapons,  transnational  organized  crime,  cybercrime  and illicit  financial  flows  among  other  aspects,  continue  to impede  our  march  towards  the  realisation  of  sustainable peace, security and stability.  The  recent  acts  of  terrorism  in  our  SADC  region  are constant  reminders  of  our  vulnerability  to  the  scourge  of terrorism  which  has  become  one  of  Africa’s  greatest security threats. African Nations need to be capacitated to effectively  counter  this  vice  along  with  the  Continental flagship  programme  on  “Silencing  the  Guns”  through, “African solutions for African problems.       As  we  commemorate  the  International  Day  for  the  Total Elimination  of  Nuclear  Weapons  during  this  High-level week, let us be mindful of the need to build trust based on international  law,  to  realize  the  shared  goal  of  a  world free of nuclear weapons.  We  remain  alarmed  by  the  global  rise  in  racial  tensions, violence and hate  crimes. Twenty years after the Durban Declaration  and  Programme  of  Action, the  socio-economic and political structures that encourage, promote and  justify  racism,  racial  discrimination,  xenophobia  and related intolerances must be torn down.   The  recent  adoption  of  the  resolution  establishing  the Permanent  Forum  of  People  of  African  Decent  is commendable. The Forum must inspire all of us to build a world  which  harnesses  our  racial  diversities,  for  global peace, harmony and sustainable development.         Respecting  and  upholding  human  rights  is  the  obligation of  all  States  as  enshrined  in  the  Charter  of  the  United Nations.  Equally,  self-determination  and  independence are  fundamental  rights  that  should  be  enjoyed  by  all people.  We  therefore  call  for  the  full  implementation  of United  Nations  Resolutions to  end  all forms  of colonialism and occupation.  Mr. President,  Based  on  the  principles  of  sovereign  equality  and independence  of  States,  the  United  Nations  Organization must  be  fair,  just  and  anchored  on  multilateralism, inclusivity  and  transparency,  to  best  serve  the  collective interests  of  all  members.  The  reform  of  the  Security Council must be expedited. My country equally supports the ongoing efforts to revitalize the General Assembly.  The  encroachment  of  other  UN  organs  on  the  mandate and competence of the General Assembly is of concern.      Finally,  the  increased  challenges  facing  the  world  today call for stronger solidarity and a renewed commitment to strengthen  multilateralism,  as  a  viable  mechanism  for achieving  and  maintaining  peace,  security,  equality, justice,  sustainable  economic  development  and the protection of our environment. I thank you.    "
13,2021,AGO,Angola,"President of the Republic of Angola, at the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly New York, September , 2021 Your Excellency, Mr. Abdulah Shahid President  of  the  76th  Session  of  the  United Nations General Assembly, Your  Excellencies,  Heads  of  State  and Government Mr. Secretary-General of the United Nations          Ladies and Gentlemen The  fact  that  I  can  be  on  this  podium  to congratulate in person on your election is a sign of  progress  in  how  we  are  dealing  with  the COVID- virus. We  have  not  yet  won  the  battle  against  the SARS-COV-  virus  but  must  note  that  we  are overcoming  the  fears,  uncertainties,  and  the feeling  of  powerlessness  of  a  year  ago,  and gradually  returning  to  normal  life,  with  all  the necessary  precautions sense  of responsibility that is required from all of us. and a The  fight  against  COVID-  and  its  new  and frightening  variants  goes  on,  and  only  our combined  efforts,  without  distinctions  between rich and poor or based on other types of social        categories, is the only way forward for us to fight this  pandemic  with  outcomes  that  meet  our populations’  expectations  of  a  full  return  to normal life. We have seen an increased global conviction that the  possibility  of  achieving  this  goal  is  real,  as vaccines  are  developed  and  introduced  by  the community  with international admirable  and  commendable  speed,  with  the larger purpose of preserving the human species, which is threatened by the COVID- pandemic. scientific It  is  therefore  urgent  that  we  establish,  in practical  terms,  a  general  understanding  that solidarity  and  streamlined  procedures  to  access vaccines  are  the  only  way  to  lead  the  world  to victory  in  the  fight  against  the  COVID- possible the pandemic,  with immunization of the inhabitants of our planet. broadest      It is shocking to see the disparity between some nations and others with respect to availability of vaccines. These disparities allow for third doses to be given, in some cases, while, in other cases, as in Africa, the vast majority of the population has not even received the first dose. The  United  Nations  must  discuss  and  adopt  decisions that are favorable toward the release of vaccine  production  patents,  so  they  may  be produced for an ever larger number of countries, making them more accessible to all. The  pandemic  that  we  face  is  global  and  thus accentuated the link and interdependence among Nations. For this reason, the COVID- vaccine must be recognized as a good for all humanity, with universal and open access to allow for wider production and equitable distribution on a global scale.      Excellencies, All  negative  effects  and  consequences  of  the COVID- pandemic in other places also had a strong impact on the economic and social life in the Republic of Angola. Nonetheless,  we  were  able  to  act  quickly, aggressively, and decisively to contain the spread of the contamination on a scale that allowed us to keep the levels of contagion within the limits of our health structures’ response capacity. Yet,  an  assessment  of  losses  resulting  from  the COVID-  pandemic  to  our  national  economy provides us with distressing results, for which we are now seeking solutions to help mitigate them and relieve the suffering of our population.        We  have  relied  on  the  support  and  efforts  that merit  our  full  appreciation,  as  they  provide  us with  some  measure  of  relief  in  terms  of  our financial  responsibilities  toward  our  creditors. This allows us to have some capacity to tend to our enormous and multiple needs. In  this  context  of  significant  degradation  in  the living  conditions  of  our  population  and  our economic  and  social  fabric,  we  must  engage  in deep reflection to find long-lasting solutions that may  serve  as  the  basis  for  rebuilding  our economies  that  have  suffered  the  most  severe impacts from this worldwide health crisis. Excellencies, The Republic of Angola has made major efforts to  contribute  to  peace  and  stability  in  Central Africa, in the Great Lakes Region and other parts of our continent.      Our sensitivity with respect to issues of peace and war is the result of our long internal conflict that lasted for several decades, which gives us a clear perspective  on importance  of  seeking solutions  for  disputes  through  dialogue  and understanding between conflicting parties. the We have sought to share our successful Angolan the experience  with  other  nations,  with conviction  that  our  action,  if  well  understood, will surely lead to favorable outcomes in ending conflicts and reestablishing peace in some of the affected countries. There  still  remain  several  conflicts  in  different regions of our planet. There seems to be no end in  sight  for  some  of  them,  due  not  only  to  the complex nature of their causes but, above all, due to  noncompliance  with  the  norms  that  govern international relations and with the principles of peaceful coexistence among peoples and nations.     We must continue to believe in the mechanisms that  are  available  to  United  Nations  to  build  a framework  of  multilateralism,  solutions  that ensure  solid  and  long-lasting  world  peace  and security. We are particularly concerned with the changes in institutional order that are occurring frequently through  the  use  of  military  force  in  African countries, as these unconstitutional acts have not spurred  an  appropriate  and  sufficient  reaction from  the  international  community  in  order  to discourage such acts, which are reprehensible in every aspect, as we have seen in Mali and, more recently, in Guinee. Therefore,  we  consider  it  necessary  that  the international  community  act  with  resolve,  and of does condemnation,  in  order  to  force  these  actors  to statements simply issue not      return  power  to  the  legitimately  established institutions. We  cannot  continue  to  allow  recent  examples, such as that of Guinee and others, to succeed in Africa  and  other  continents.  This  is  a  great the  Heads  of  State  and opportunity Government  gathered  here  to  demand,  with  a single  voice,  the  immediate  and  unconditional release  of  the  President  of  the  Republic  of Guinee, Professor Alpha Cond. for We are concerned with the threats to world peace and security from the actions of extremist groups in the African Sahel, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in Mozambique, and in other parts of  our  world,  which  require  the  continuous mobilization  of  the  international  community  to strengthen  our  capacity  to  respond  to  these dangerous activities against social and economic stability in those countries.     Unfortunately,  we  have  been  seeing  a  return  to the  use  of  mercenaries,  with  the  recruitment, from  anywhere  in  the  world,  of  professionals without  armies,  paid  to  kill,  to  destabilize countries,  to  oust  democratically  elected  but troublesome  politicians  and regimes.  This phenomenom used to be strongly condemned and fought  but,  unfortunately,  it  is  now  encouraged and  fed  by  powerful  forces  hiding  behind anonymity. The  United  Nations,  the  African  Union,  and, generally,  the  International  Community,  must encourage the Ethiopian authorities to find better ways to put an end to the conflict in the Tigray region, and counter the threat of a humanitarian catastrophe before it becomes more serious and too late.      Climate  change  is  in  today’s  agenda,  judging from  the  grave  consequences  that  humanity  is facing in all continents. The frequency and ferocity of hurricanes, floods, forest  fires,  landslides,  volcano  eruptions,  and earthquakes  that  devastate  entire  cities  and population centers in rural areas, sometimes with a  significant  number  of  deaths,  should  draw everyone’s  attention,  from  governments,  non-the  academy, governmental  organizations, scientists, civil society, to the need for concerted efforts  to  protect  planet  Earth,  our  common home,  which  has  been  giving  us  increasingly clear signals that she is not happy with how we treat  her,  and  is  defending  herself  in  the  most violent manner possible. Thank you very much for your attention.        "

16,2021,SWZ,Eswatini,"President, Your Excellencies, Heads of State and Government,  United Nations Secretary-General, Distinguished delegates,  Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. President, It  is  my  singular  honour  to  address  the  76th  Session  of  the  United  Nations  General  Assembly. Allow me to express my sincere congratulations to you Mr. President, on your election as President of  the  76th  session  of  the  United  Nations  General  Assembly.  We  commend  the  outstanding leadership  and  sterling  performance  of  the  outgoing  President.  I  also  extend  our  profound congratulations  to  the  Secretary-General  of  the  United  Nations,  His  Excellency  Mr.  Antnio Guterres, for his re-election for another five-year term.  The theme of this session touches on every aspect of our daily lives. It underscores the need to ensure that the world does not lose sight of the three dimensions of sustainable development during the last decade of implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development – the “Decade of  Action.”  Over  the  past  year,  the  Kingdom  of  Eswatini  experienced  immeasurable  and unimaginable setbacks in the implementation of our development priorities since the start of the Covid- pandemic. This compelled the country to rethink its development strategy and re-direct its resources to cater for additional needs of the population. Nevertheless, we have not lost sight of the objective of the 2030 Agenda: “To leave no one behind.”  Mr. President, Sincere appreciation goes to all the frontline medical workers who have become the first line of defence in the battle against the virulent pandemic, labouring tirelessly to keep us safe. Many of them throughout this challenging period lost their lives for our sake. Without their commitment and sacrifice, the world would not be anywhere near the path to recovery from this pandemic. In the same vein, similar appreciation and honour also goes to all involved in research, sharing of expertise  and  resource  mobilisation,  be  it  institutions  and  individuals,  for  the  successful development of vaccines.  It is without doubt that the panacea for any practical, effective and efficient plan to recover from the COVID- pandemic rests on vaccination of national populations. This has been demonstrated and proven in countries that have endeavoured to achieve herd immunity. Low access to vaccines by many countries remains a cause for concern. Such a scenario has been more pronounced in developing  countries,  especially  countries  in  special  situations,  in  Africa,  and  other  vulnerable regions. This was one of the pressing reasons why Eswatini supported the call for a  temporary waiver  of  the  obligation  of  member  states  under  the  TRIPS  Agreement  to  protect  intellectual property rights for technologies related to the prevention, containment or treatment of COVID-. The  Kingdom  of  Eswatini  applauds  the  establishment  of  the  COVAX  Facility,  which  came  to existence through efforts by the United Nations, in the wake of the pandemic and solely meant to be  of  assistance  to  member  states,  particularly  low  middle-income  countries.  As  a  beneficiary,           Eswatini  is  grateful  for such an  initiative and also extends further appreciation  to  the generous donors, particularly the United States of America amongst many others, whom in their absence, the objectives of this initiative would not have been achieved thus far.  Mr. President, In  this  view,  the  Kingdom  of  Eswatini  commends  African  countries  that  have  commenced manufacturing  COVID-  vaccines.  We  bank  on  the  successful  implementation  of  the  African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) to widen and strengthen Africa’s integration process. We are confident that this arrangement will create and/or strengthen the value chains and the ability for African countries to produce more vaccines. Eswatini has prioritized health, for every member of the population is at the center of our socio-economic agenda. Currently, a significant percentage of the eligible population has been vaccinated, having commenced with our frontline staff and the elderly,  most  recently,  effective  30th  August  2021,  the  Eswatini  Government  commenced inoculating all aged  years and above. We aim at reaching herd immunity hopefully by the end of 2021.  Mr. President, Resilience is a multifaceted and complex concept that  calls for our attention to comprehend its meaning academically and in practice. It entails the ability to bounce-back, build-back and build better from any situation that confronts us. In the context of the pandemic, resilience transcends the health sector to cut-accross all sectors of the economy. The Kingdom of Eswatini believes that the starting point of building resilience through hope entails access to vaccination by all eligible populations, and while doing so, ensuring that no one is left behind. This will determine the ability, power and speed to recover from COVID-, and to rebuild sustainably.  Like many other countries, the pandemic has been an eye-opener to the Kingdom of Eswatini and has overly sensitized Government to ‘re-think resilience’ and incorporate it in all its policies. In this view, building resilience has become a cornerstone and  an inevitable component in all our mitigation, adaptation strategies and recovery plans.  Mr. President, The pandemic has, momentarily, shifted our focus from issues that are perpetually on the global agenda, particularly our quest to respond to the needs of the planet including the mitigation and adaptation  to  the  persisting  impact  of  climate  change.  Nonetheless,  it  has  highlighted  our interconnectedness in all facets of our daily lives and further clarified the meaning and practicality of living in a global village. Climate-related impacts continue to overwhelm our economies and remains one of the insistent challenges of the 21st century. The Kingdom of Eswatini has not lost sight of its commitment to respond to the needs of the planet. In this view, we reaffirm our resolve to play our part in operationalizing the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) that presents  steps  taken  by  the  country  to  develop  effective  climate  change  responses,  while  fast-tracking  the  implementation  of  our  objectives  for  sustainable  development  and  poverty eradication. We look forward to the 26th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework            Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for the world to re-ignite, re-engage and accelerate climate actions.  Mr. President, Education is an important tool utilized to equip, capacitate, develop and empower every learner to create  and/or  sustain  development  and  attain  the  future  we  want.  The  closure  of  schools  and institutions of higher learning due to the pandemic, has had an unparalleled devastating impact to millions  of  learners.  This  has  been  more  pronounced  in  the  developing  world,  mainly  because many of these countries are not adequately equipped to pursue their education virtually.  The impact of students being out of school for an extended period of time was enormous and a nightmare in many developing countries. The lack of access to digital learning resources was a setback  to  students’  learning  opportunities.  Upon  resumption  of  classes  in  the  Kingdom  of Eswatini, schools had to stagger attendance in order to prevent the snowballing of infections and the spread of the virus, as it evolves and changes phases.  Mr. President, It is important to highlight the fact that our  economies have been severely battered, businesses continue to close down and people are losing jobs, Governments are struggling with rising debt levels.  Eswatini  is  therefore  appreciative  of  the  decision  by  the  Board  of  Governors  of  the International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  to  approve  Special  Drawing  Rights  (SDR)  to  boost  global liquidity, this cash injection of over $ million to the economy of Eswatini could not have come at a better time. On Monday 06th September 2021, His Majesty King Mswati III,  launched the Reconstruction Fund, meant to rebuild infrastructure and the economy, following a civil unrest which was brought about  by a vast array of economic challenges including the added burden of the Covid- pandemic, and these funds will assist Government advance closer to the budget target of $200 million. Mr. President, On another note, in the fight against HIV and AIDS, Eswatini has continued to employ all means possible to stop the spread of the virus even during this critical time in history. This is evidenced by  the  achievement  of  the  UNAIDS  goal  of  --,  which  summarily  means    percent  of people with HIV identified,  percent of people with HIV on treatment, and  percent of people on  treatment  virally  suppressed.  Although  this  was  deemed  achievable,  in  a  decade  from  now, fortunately the Kingdom is now one of only two countries to have made such an achievement of SDG goal number three on health, as announced by the United Nations body.  In Eswatini, as much as some of our plans to accelerate the process have been derailed, we have remained focused. Since 2016, the country has integrated the SDGs into the national development framework  and  put  in  place  appropriate  institutional  arrangements  to  ensure  that  the implementation is properly monitored at all levels. Government has infused the spirit of ownership to every citizen, so that every individual understands and appreciates the importance of the SDGs.            Both the Executive and Legislative arms of Government are involved. In the midst of the obtaining challenges, we have not lost hope and sight of our development agenda. Mr. President, As  the  reforms  of  the  United  Nations  development  system  evolves,  the  Kingdom  of  Eswatini continues to steadfastly reiterate and maintain its call for Africa’s voice to be heard at the United Nations Security Council. This follows an annual call by the African Union Heads of State and Government articulated in the Ezulwini Consensus and Sirte Declaration. The Common African Position  remains  intact  with  regard  to  allocation  of  permanent  and  non-permanent  seats  in  the United Nations Security Council, a very important decision-making Organ of the United Nations. When  all  members  and  regions  are  efficiently  and  effectively  represented  and  their  voice conspicuously heard, the revitalization of the work of the United Nations will be enhanced.  Mr. President, May I take this opportunity to share with the nations of the world how the Tinkhundla System of governance works. The elections conducted under this system embrace our traditional and cultural existence where people from communities nominate candidates in their chiefdoms to compete at constituency level, which we call Tinkhundla. This system was agreed upon by the nation through consultations. A Commission was set up to consult widely the populace as to which governance system they would like to have in place as a nation. The  winners  then  go  straight  to  parliament  as  a  direct  representation  -  some  of  the  elected candidates end up being members of cabinet. As a result, the people are part of the government formulation  process  because  they  can  claim  ownership  of  the  people  who  constitute  the government of the day. We are convinced that our system of governance has a place in modern day democracy and it complies with all structures of the United Nations family. The Kingdom of Eswatini is committed to the ideals of the United Nations in just as much as she is dedicated to protecting its history, legacy, and dignity. While at the same time embracing the opportunities and the possibilities of cooperating in the community of nations.  It is, therefore, the Kingdom of Eswatini’s position that it believes in democracy as an idea but not as an ideal because things that are ideal to you may not be ideal to other people. The Kingdom of Eswatini will, however, continue to embrace the opportunities, technologies and the mechanisms that create a modern society. Our country is committed to a process of consultation with the people at the people’s parliament, Sibaya, and other dialogue forums through which people provide advice and counsel to the King that ensures transparency and accountability. This is how our monarchy operates, in  counsel.  As  such, the practice is  democratic and participatory in  that everybody is involved  in  our  key  decision-making  processes.  As  a  nation  we  shall  remain  seized  with  the preservation of our cultural norms and traditions, promoting of peace and stability, addressing our different opinions in a peaceful manner, not by violence. Above all this, dialogue is at the apex of our existence as a nation.             Our philosophy is inclusive, we use a bottom-up approach, from the grass roots level, where every Liswati must have an opportunity to voice his or her opinion in a free and fair environment. whilst we embrace modernity, we cannot forget who we are and where we come from, our identity as a nation remains pivotal so that we can work together to develop our country and ensure that we realize  a  robust  social  and  economic  foundation  for  the  benefit  of  future  generations  as  our predecessors have done. Mr. President, The  persistent  exclusion  of  the  Republic  of  China  (Taiwan)  from  the  United  Nations  and  the discrimination of its citizens in a system meant to serve international citizens, is a gross violation of  the  unshakeable  principles  of  the  UN  Charter.  Since  the  start  of  the  COVID-  pandemic, Taiwan  in  solidarity  with  UN  Member  States,  made  a  significant  contribution  in  realizing  the theme of this year's Session. Eswatini would again this year continue to urge the United Nations to consider the meaningful participation of Taiwan, especially in the World Health Organisation, International Civil Aviation Authority and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. With this inclusion of Taiwan, it is our hope that the UN will be living up to its objectives and equally serving the interests of all its Member States. The path to 2030 on the attainment of the UN SDGs was dented as a result of the pandemic, and Taiwan, adhering to the principle of living no one behind, shared it's disease prevention expertise and experience with more than  countries & further assisted  countries make headway in ICT, agriculture, education and health. Furthermore this year, in demonstrating that ""Taiwan Can Help, and  Taiwan  is  Helping"",  Taiwan  continued  to  send  medical  assistance,  in  the  form  of  medical specialists and protective equipment for Eswatini’s health sector. It is in this light that we call upon for the recognition of Taiwan's efforts for the global wellbeing. Lastly, the Kingdom of Eswatini can attest to the fact that Taiwan is an indispensable partner and would, if given an opportunity, play a meaningful role in the global body. Mr. President, Finally, allow me to take this opportunity to wish the United Nations family a prosperous future as we battle COVID-, to rebuild sustainably and respond to the needs of the people. Thank you and May the Almighty God bless us all.            "
17,2021,LSO,Lesotho,"President of the 76th Session of the General Assembly, Your Excellencies Heads of State and Government, Your  Excellency  Mr.  Antnio  Guterres,  the  Secretary  General  of  the United Nations, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, On behalf of the Government and people of Lesotho, I extend our most sincere congratulations to you on your election to preside over the seventy sixth (76th) session  of the United Nations General  Assembly (UNGA)  and wish you  every success in the discharge of your duties. We are confident that your personal, diplomatic  and  leadership  qualities  will  guide  us  through  the  session.  My delegation assures you of our full support and cooperation. Let me also pay a well-deserved  tribute,  and  express  our  thanks  and  gratitude,  to  your predecessor, His Excellency Volkan Bozkir. We thank him particularly for his statesmanship, sterling guidance and effective organization during the difficult times of the seventy fifth session.  To  Secretary-  General  Antonio  Guterres,  we  are  deeply  indebted  for  your continued  dynamic  leadership  and  commitment  to  our  organization,  and  for your  relentless  efforts  in  achieving  the  Organization’s  goals.  We  particularly commend  you  for  tireless  efforts  during  an  arduous  time  when  COVID- reared its ugly head and upended our world. We also congratulate you on your re-election for a second term and assure you of our utmost support.     The convening of the High-level week of the General Assembly is yet another opportunity for world leaders and policy makers to demonstrate their resolve and political will to further advance the purposes and principles of the Charter of  the  United  Nations  through  concerted  multilateral  efforts.  It  is  also  an opportune moment for the UN system entities to demonstrate their continued commitments in support of national efforts.  Mr. President, Allow me to thank you for advancing a very befitting theme for this session of the  UNGA,  “Building  resilience  through  hope  –  to  recover  from  COVID-, rebuild sustainability, respond to the needs of the planet, respect the right of people, and revitalize the United Nations”. The United Nations was born  years ago when the brutality of war impressed itself  on  all  as  far  beyond  human  comprehension  and  tolerance.  The Organization  became  a  source  of  hope,  founded  as  it  was  on  the  inalienable, interlinked and mutually interdependent pillars of development, human rights and  security.  The  resolve  to  form  the  United  Nations  was  propelled  by  a determination to create a world of peace and prosperity.  In his address to the United Nations General Assembly on  January 2021, the Secretary General described a world in danger and warned of the consequences of  the  failure  to  work  together.  He  stated  that  “2020  was  a  global  annus horribilis – a year of death, disaster and despair.” He further called for bold action to overcome the devastation in 2020 resulting from the global COVID- pandemic. It gives great pleasure to pay a deserving tribute to the Secretary-General  for  galvanizing  support  and  mainstreaming  the  fight  against  the COVID- pandemic in the work of the United Nations system.                                   His leadership in spearheading the mobilization of resources through and other international partners in this war are highly commendable.  This Session of the General Assembly comes at a critical time and momentous conjuncture  in  human  history;  indeed,  this  is  the  time  when  circumstances compel  us  to  reiterate  our  plea  to  the  international  community  to  adopt  an expanded  and  comprehensive  response  to  the  COVID    pandemic.  Such  a comprehensive response would complement individual countries on concerted efforts to halt the continuing spread of the pandemic.  We  recall  COVID-  Omnibus  Resolution  entitled:  “Comprehensive  and Coordinated Response to the COVID- Pandemic”, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly last year in September 2020, underscored the need to tackle health inequities and inequalities within and among countries through political commitment, policies and international cooperation. The World Health Organization recently promulgated an unpleasant warning that unless nations act urgently to slow the spread of the coronavirus, the world could log another 100 million infections by 2021.  Apart from posing a significant threat to health, it is also common knowledge that  the  COVID-  pandemic  has  also  emerged  as  a  major  threat  to development  and  continues  to  adversely  impact  global  travel,  disrupt  trade, tourism  and  other  economic  activities.  We,  therefore,  reiterate  the  need  for converging  efforts,  to  continue  to  fight  collectively  to  address  and  overcome this unprecedented global crisis in solidarity.      We are also concerned by the emerging COVID  delta variant, which has been reported  by  several  Member  States.  This  could  present  a  peril  to  the international  community  if  it  is  not  addressed  timely.  It  could  also  result  in devastating  situations  especially  in  Africa.  On  this  auspicious  occasion,  my delegation  expresses  sincere  appreciation  for  all  initiatives  recently  taken through COVAX to address the needs of developing countries, especially in the development, production, and equitable access to COVID- tests, treatments and vaccines. Mr. President, Exactly six years ago, the UNGA adopted a comprehensive set of universal and transformative  sustainable  development  goals  and  targets  aimed  at  ending poverty,  protecting  the  planet,  and  ensuring  that  all  people  enjoy  peace  and prosperity by 2030. Now with nearly nine years remaining, the prospects of the world  reaching  these  forward-looking  goals  remain  on  the  distant  horizon. What is even more worrisome is the Secretary General’s Report, covering the period  ended  in  July  this  year,  which  reveals  that  by  the  beginning  of  the pandemic  the  world  was  already  not  on  track  to  meet  the  sustainable development goals and their targets.  The  situation  now  has  been  exacerbated  by  the  devastating  impacts  of  the pandemic  on  sustainable  development,  with  the  most  vulnerable  countries, particularly the landlocked least developed countries such as Lesotho being the hardest  hit.  These  countries  therefore  require  sustainable  and  inclusive recovery strategies to accelerate progress towards the full implementation of the 2030 agenda.    As we are heading towards the Fifth United Nations Conference on the Least Development Countries in Doha, Qatar next year, we only remain hopeful for the consensus adoption of an ambitious new Programme of Action that should properly focus on the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and above all that will be geared towards ensuring that the severely struggling are not left behind in achieving the SDGs. Again, as we begin the decade of action and try to build back better, Lesotho remains steadfast in calling on the international community to increase funding for  sound  health  services,  increased  investment  in  physical  infrastructure, scientific and technological development, research and agricultural extension services in least developed countries. We believe that such bold steps would help  us get  back  on  the trajectory  of  realizing the  full implementation  of the SDGs in this tight remaining period. Mr. President, With concern over climate change, creating a global coalition to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 should be high on the UN agenda ahead of COP26 in Glasgow later this year. The  recently  published  Report  of  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate Change  reveals  that  it  is  now  certain  that  hot  extremes  have  become  more frequent  and  more  intense  across  most  regions  of  the  world,  while  cold extremes have become less frequent and less severe, thereby confirming that human- induced climate change is the main driver of these aberrations.        The  report  further  asserts  that  some  recent  hot  extremes  observed  over  the past  decade  would  have  been  extremely  unlikely  to  occur  without  human influence on the climate system. Indeed,  this  greatest  challenge  of  our  time  which  has  a  pronounced  severe negative  impact  on  African  least  developed  countries  manifested  through droughts, excessive rainfall, desertification, hurricanes, land degradation and so  forth  thus  diminishing  our  capability  to  eradicate  poverty  and  improve livelihoods. It is equally important to note that biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation just like climate change are also among the top threats facing humanity today. It is therefore undoubtedly vivid that now more than ever, there is need to take urgent  and  bold  global  actions  to  combat  climate  change  and  its  impacts  on humanity. Similarly, the onus is on us as leaders of the world to ensure that our mother  earth  does not  lose  its  biodiversity  since  that  poses  a  threat on  food security and livelihoods of people across the world.  To  ensure  conformity  with  the  Paris  Agreement  protocols  over  some  years now,  the  Kingdom  of  Lesotho  has  joined  effort  with  the  rest  of  the  world  to increase climate change resilience and improve the well-being of the Basotho nation, through mainstreaming climate change into our development programs and  implementing  concrete  measures  for  adaptation  and  climate  risk reduction, mitigation and low-carbon development to achieve green growth.      Furthermore,  there  are  several  initiatives  and  programmes  implemented  by the  Government  of  Lesotho  to  address  the  impacts  of  climate  change.  For instance, Lesotho submitted her Nationally Determined Contributions Report to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in June 2018, outlining initiatives to be undertaken to reduce greenhouse gases and adapt to climate  change.  In  addition,  some  of  the  noteworthy  initiatives  are  the Integrated  Catchment  Management,  improvement  of  Early  Warning  System, formulation  of  the  National  Adaptation  Plan,  improving  adaptive  capacity  of vulnerable  and  food  insecure  populations  in  the  country.  Again,  Lesotho intends to unconditionally lower her net greenhouse gas emissions by % by 2030  and  to  further  push  for  an  additional  %  greenhouse  gas  emission reduction, provided that external support including capacity building is made available  to  us  to  cover  the  full  cost  of  implementing  the  adaptation  and mitigation actions.  Guided by the principle of leaving no one behind, Lesotho continues to call on the international  community  and  other  regional  and international organizations to support climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts and strengthen  resilience,  particularly  to  vulnerable  countries,  thus  bringing  the attainment of the SDGs within reasonable reach. Mr. President, It is the obligation of all Member States to promote and protect the rights of all. We  are  therefore  pleased  that  this  important  factor  has  over  the  years remained to be on the agenda of every session of the UNGA. The International Human Rights Instruments provide a clear path and a legal framework for all     States  to  fully  advance  the  status  of  vulnerable  groups  in  a  quest  to  ending inequalities  in  our  communities.  My  own  country  Lesotho  is  a  long-standing party  to  International  Human  Rights  treaties  such  as  the  International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms  of  Discrimination  against  Women,  the  Convention  on  the  Rights  of Persons  with  Disabilities  and  the  Convention  on  the  Rights  of  the  Child  to mention a few. It remains a responsibility for all Member States, to pursue a common goal of ensuring the effectiveness and enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms  for  all.  It  is  however,  disturbing  that  in  conflict-  stricken  regions, particularly in armed conflict, civilians still endure inhumane treatment that is in violation of laws and regulations established to protect humankind. Lesotho condemns  all  forms  of  attacks  to  the  civilian  populations  and  urge  parties involved  in  any  form  of  conflict,  to  cease  aggressions  and  engage  in  talks genuinely  aimed  at  achieving  a  long-  lasting  solution  and  promoting  human rights for all. Mr. President Trafficking in Persons continues to be a chronic challenge affecting the globe. Member  States  are  facing  challenges  on  how  to  translate  the  international efforts  to  combating  all  forms  of  trafficking-in-persons  into  reality.  Lesotho fully  supports  the  2021  Political  Declaration  on  the  implementation  of  the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons therefore calls upon all Member States and all Stakeholders to accelerate implementation of all guiding tools as contained in the outcome document.      This  year  as  we  celebrate  twenty  years  since  the  adoption  of  the  Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, which together with relevant outcome documents,  provide  an  inclusive  United  Nations  framework  and  solid foundation  to  fight  the  scourge  against  racism  and  racial  discrimination, xenophobia, and related intolerance.  Lesotho acknowledges progress achieved in other parts of the world to fight against racism, however, it remains a major concern that the plague persists in all parts of the world and a vast number of human beings continue to be victims to this date. Lesotho therefore urges all Member  States  to  collectively  promote  and  protect  rights  for  all  and  restore dignity of peoples who have experienced the worst brunt of the evils of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia, and related intolerance.   Mr. President, Revitalization of the United Nations General Assembly merits our attention and should remain high on our agenda especially at this time that, more than ever, there is dire need for solidarity and unwavering commitment to multilateralism and  to  the UN.  Lesotho  would therefore  like  to  echo  other Member  States in calling for an inclusive UN system which encompasses equal representation of all regions in all the major organs of this august body. Strengthening of the UN organs particularly the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council would  also  ensure  that  all  the  political  and  socio-economic  challenges  that humanity is currently facing are tackled collectively in an efficient and effective manner, thus leaving no one and most importantly no country behind.      Mr. President, Member States of this Organization have increasingly yearned for its reform in order to make it more democratic and responsive to the needs of all nations, rich and poor, big and small, strong and weak. We should recall that the last reform  of  the  United  Nations  was  in  1963,  over  five  decades  ago.  We  are convinced that this is the opportune time to raise critical issues regarding the reform of this world body to enable it to meet the challenges and threats of the twenty-first century — a daunting task indeed. We  regrettably  note  that  some  Member  States  have  relegated  to  the  back burner critical issues of development, giving priority instead to security issues. To move in unison, the international community should strive to advance the global  development,  human  rights  and  security  agendas  simultaneously. Terrorism,  proliferation  of  weapons  of  mass  destruction  to  non-State  actors, the  existence  of  nuclear  weapons,  and  armed  conflict  top  the  list  of  global security issues. On this note, we commend the Secretary General for convening the  Second  United  Nations  High-Level  Conference  of  Heads  of  Counter-Terrorism  Agencies  of  Member  States in  June  this  year  with the  overarching theme  “Countering  and  Preventing  Terrorism  in  the  Age  of  Transformative Technologies: Addressing the Challenges of the New Decade”. The Conference provided a significant and timely opportunity for participants to consider the practical  implementation  of  relevant  aspects  of  the  United  Nations  Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. The  Kingdom  of  Lesotho  considers  it  the  responsibility  of  the  international community,  with  the  United  Nations  playing  the  central  role,  to  put  in  place    effective  measures  aimed  at  preventing  genocide,  ethnic  cleansing  and  the atrocities  perpetrated  on  women  and  children  caught  up  in  armed  conflict. Consequently, my delegation considers the enhanced role of the major organs of the United Nations, particularly the General Assembly, to be of paramount importance. Lesotho is supportive of any effort that will bring about lasting and sustainable peace in the Middle East, in conflict areas in Africa, and other parts of the world.  In  today’s  globalized  world,  it  is  indefensible  and  incomprehensible  that decisions which bind us all are left in the hands of few Member States. Reform of the Security Council, which takes into account the aspirations of Africa, as espoused  in  the  Ezulwini  Consensus  and  the  Sirte  Declaration  cannot  be postponed any longer. Transparency, inclusivity and democracy must inform the work of the entire United Nations System. The Ezulwini Consensus provides a  progressive  implementation  of  a  fair  and  prudent  reform  of  the  Security Council, which is crucial for the African Continent’s representation in this new multilateral world order. Mr. President It  is  in  this  twenty-first  century  that  peace,  security,  the  right  to  self-determination, respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms must be guaranteed as the norm rather than the exception. Hence, our call for the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people and complete withdrawal from their occupied territories, as well as the independence of the Saharawi people. We  also  renew  our  call  for  the  lifting  of  the  unilateral  economic  embargo against the people of Cuba.     These matters must be addressed and resolved urgently, comprehensively and honestly, without fear or favour, and without malice to anybody. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been going on for far too long. It is about time that individual interests gave way to compassion and reason so that the People of Palestine can enjoy their inalienable right to self-determination in our lifetime.  The  road  to  lasting  peace  is  paved  with  pain  and  hardship,  difficult concessions will have to be made in order to satisfy the desires of both sides. It is our view that the conflict must be ended through negotiations that are based on  the  respect  of  sovereign  equality  and  the  recognition  of  the  rights  and legitimate concerns of all Parties involved.  The people of Western Sahara yearn for peace, freedom and the attainment of a right to determine their own destiny. For many years now, efforts by the UN to facilitate transition to independence have not yielded any concrete results. It is regrettable that the continued denial of the Sahrawi people’s exercise of their inalienable right to self-determination remains unresolved. We look forward to the  conclusion  of  the  process  in  Western  Sahara  so  that  the  people  of  that country can freely determine their own future.  Over the past three decades, the U.N. General Assembly has consistently voted against  unilateral  coercive  measures  through  economic,  commercial  and financial blockade of Cuba but to no avail. As a result, the people of Cuba have been  subjected  to  undue  suffering,  which  was  further  exacerbated  by  the COVID-.  We  renew  our  call  for  the  lifting  of  this  embargo  that  has  had  an adverse impact on its economy and brought untold sorrow and agony to the     Cuban people.  Similarly unilateral coercive measures continue to be applied on the  people  of  Zimbabwe  despite  repeated  resolutions  against  same  by  the community of nations. We renew our call for removal of these sanctions. Mr. President The real test for the United Nations in this century is how far it is prepared to go in addressing all these challenges and how far it will go in turning promises into reality, thus enabling a large majority of the people of the world to fulfil their potential and realize their aspirations. While we appreciate the magnitude of these challenges, we continue to have faith in the United Nations capacity to solve global problems, its broad universal support and its ability to uphold and reaffirm  our  shared  values  of  peace,  equity,  social  justice,  democracy  and human rights.  I wish to conclude by pointing out that, we often come here to set lofty goals for members of the United Nations but fail to walk the talk. History will judge us harshly if we continue to defer the aspirations of people across the world in their  quest  for  equality,  freedom,  peace  and  prosperity.  Such  is  the  call  and challenge staring in the face of the United Nations in the 21st century.  I THANK YOU        "
18,2021,NAM,Namibia,"President . Namibia joins  other  member states in congratulating you on your election as President of the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly, which is convened under the theme: Building  resilience  through  hope- to  recover from COVID-, rebuild sustainability, respond to the needs of the planet, respect the rights of people, and revitalize the United Nations.  . We also wish to commend the Secretary General, His  Excellency  Antnio  Guterres, for  his profound  and  moving  statement,  highlighting the  many  challenges  the  world  is  faced  with today while imploring world leaders to act now 	 to  solve  these  problems.  Your  Excellency,  we have heard your clarion call loud and clear.  Mr. President . For  the  second  year  in  a  row,  the  world  finds itself engulfed by the dark cloud of the Covid- pandemic which continues to claim thousands of lives daily. However, there is a light at the end of the tunnel.  . Global  efforts  to  develop  vaccines  have  been  a scientific  triumph  and  a  testament  to  human ingenuity. In just under a year the unimaginable has  happened.  Several  different  vaccines  have been  tested,  and  produced  to  be  delivered  to millions  around  the  world.  Unfortunately,  the global  rollout  of  the  vaccine  has  not  been 	 impervious to the scourge of inequality. Vaccine Apartheid  has  resulted  in  significant  disparities in terms of vaccine rollout and availability, with many people in developing countries left out. It is a pity that we have a situation where in some countries,  citizens  are  at  the  stage  of  receiving booster shots while in other countries, many are still  waiting  to  receive  their  first  doses  of vaccines.  Let  us  bear  in  mind  that,  “No  one  is safe unless we are all safe.”    . The  Covid-  has  impacted  poorer  countries more  acutely  and  unevenly.  Faced  with  high levels of debt and insufficient access to finance, developing  countries  are  struggling  to  mitigate the  severe  effects  of  the  crisis.  Namibia 	 however, aims deploy innovative approaches to ensure  sustainable  economic  development  in this  volatile  period  of  the  Covid-  pandemic and Climate Change.   . Given  our  renewable  resources  such  as  solar, wind as well as the ocean, Namibia has decided to prioritize the development of green and blue economies.    Furthermore,  we  are  also  well positioned  through  our  recent  membership  to the High-Level Panel on Ocean Sustainability, to design  and  champion  a  sustainable  “blue economy”,  which  will  grow  our  economic  base and  create  the  much-needed  jobs,  while  also tackling climate change. 	 . Additionally,  Namibia  has  made  progress  in incubating renewable energy assets in the form of  Green  Hydrogen  and  Ammonia  as  part  of  its energy transition through green industrialization. To this end, the country is at an advanced stage in the bid evaluation process for the development of several sites for the export of green hydrogen.   Mr. President, Responding to the needs of the planet requires us  to  enhance  our  Governance  architectures  in order to enable us to act in the best interest of our planet and its citizens. To this extent, Africa has come a long way from the days of the First Wave  of  African leaders, extraordinary 	 personalities,  who  paved  the  way  towards independence.  Following  this  period,  global conflict in the form of the Cold War, resulted in Africa’s Second Wave leaders being caught up in the  malaise  of  military  coups  and  One-Party States.  However,  having  emerged  from  this tumultuous  period,  the  Third  Wave  of  African leaders  have  ushered  in  an  era  defined  by democratic  elections  and  term  limits.  As  the third  President  of  Namibia since  our independence  in  1990,  I  am  in  currently  in  my second  and  final  term  which  will  end  on  March , 2025. This is the new order on the continent. We  admit  that  there  have  been  reversals  but wherever  such  incidents  have  taken  place,  the 	 African Union, supported by respective Regional Economic Communities (RECs), has ensured that perpetrators  are  ostracised.  This  is  the  New Africa, and Africa which belies in Constitutional Order. Mr. President,       . Namibia stands firm in its belief that there is no room for discrimination of any kind in this world. In  this  regard,  we  remain  committed  to  the implementation  of  The  Durban  Declaration  and Programme of Action, which embodies our firm commitment as the international community to rid  the  world  from  the  scourges  of  racism, xenophobia  and  related intolerance  at  the national, regional and international level. 	 . The question of Palestine, now into its 73rd year after  the  Nakba,  remains  unresolved.  On  this crucial  issue,  Namibia  wishes  to  amplify  the statement  by  Secretary  General  Guterres  who explicitly  stated  that  leaders  on  both  sides should “resume  a  meaningful  dialogue, recognizing  the  two-State  solution  as  the  only pathway  to  a  just  and  comprehensive  peace”. Similarly,  it  has  now  been  nearly    years  and still the people of Western Sahara are waiting for their  right  to  exercise  their  inalienable  right  to freedom  and  independence.  Namibia  welcomes the  appointment  of  His  Excellency  Alexander Ivanko  by  the  Secretary  General  as  his  Special Representative for Western Sahara. We hope the 	 new  Special  Representative  will  devote  his  full attention to the matter to enable the people of Western  Sahara  to  have  the  opportunity  to exercise their right to  self-determination without further delay.  . In the  same  vein  Mr.  President, in accordance  with  the  resolutions  unanimously adopted by this august Assembly, we call for an end  of  the  economic,  commercial  and  financial embargo by the United States against Cuba. The people  of  Cuba  deserve to  pursue the developmental  aspirations  and  attain  economic freedom.  We  call  on  President  Biden,  who  was an invaluable  member  of the  Obama Administration  which  sought  rapprochement 	 between  Washington  and  Havana,  to  rekindle that spirit of respect and peace between the USA and Cuba, which President Obama pursued.  Mr. President .  Namibia  is  committed  to  the  reform  of  the UN Security Council, as a member of the African Union Committee of Ten. We therefore call on all countries  to  support  the  reform  of  the  UN Security  Council in line  with  the  Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration.  Mr. President,  .  As  we  continue  to  build  back  better,  we have  a  collective  responsibility  to  ensure  the 	  participation  of  women  at  all levels  of governance and economic activity as a symbol of freedom  and  equality in  society.  Namibia believes that  women’s  participation  and representation is  central  to  equitable  and sustainable development. Thus,  Namibia continues  to  advocate  for  increased  gender equality around the world, and we set ourselves the  challenge  of  leading  by  example  in  our policies, programmes and actions.  . Similarly,  we  take  cognizance  of  the  fact that  our  youth  are  the  backbones  of  the  global village  and  the  custodians  of  the  keys  to humanity’s  future.  Therefore,  Namibia  remains committed to supporting the development of our 	 young  people  and  promoting  greater  youth participation  in  all  areas  of  society,  since  they have  a  critical  role  to  play  in  promoting  global peace and development.  Mr.President, .  We  face  the  most  critical  period  in  human history. Global peace is at stake, human dignity is at stake and the future of our global village is at stake. As we meet in this global parliament of humanity, we are called upon by the citizens of this world to craft a collective way forward that will ensure that we recover from the devastation of Covid- and chart a way forward towards a brighter  future.  Although  the  task  may  seem daunting,  through  unity  of  purpose,  we  will 	 prevail. For where there is unity, there is hope to overcome Covid-, where there is unity, people can  return  to  rebuilding  sustainably,  where there  is  unity,  we  can  respond  to  the  needs  of the  planet  and  respect  the  rights  of  all  people. Indeed,  through  unity,  we  will  revitalize  the United Nations, transforming it into a bastion of global democracy that will save the world from the  scourge  of  war  and  reaffirm  faith  in  the fundamental human rights, dignity and worth of each and every human being on this planet.    I thank you.  	 "
19,2021,ZAF,South Africa,"President of the 76th Session of the UN General Assembly, Mr Abdulla Shahid, Secretary General, Mr Antnio Guterres, Excellencies Heads of State and Government, Colleagues, Friends, We join today’s General Debate from around the world. The  COVID-  pandemic  has  forever  changed  the  nature  of  multilateral  engagement,  of diplomacy, of business, of basic human interaction.  And  yet  even  as  we  are  separated  by  the  expanses  of  geography,  the  noble  ideals  of fellowship, solidarity and cooperation stand firm. They are the bedrock on which the United Nations was formed  years ago, and they have been our guide as we confront the worst global health emergency in over a century. The COVID- pandemic has caused great devastation around the world.  Millions of lives have been lost and livelihoods have been destroyed.  It has shaken our sense of well-being and security.                  Yet,  the  strong  bonds  of  solidarity  between  nations  have  enabled  us  to  overcome  great Check Against Delivery  challenges. It  was  through multilateral  solidarity,  support  and  cooperation between  Member  States  that countries in need were able to access much needed medical equipment and supplies. In dealing with the Covid  pandemic it is generally agreed that vaccines are the greatest defence that humanity has against the ravages of this pandemic. It is therefore a great concern that  the  global  community  has  not  sustained  the  principles  of  solidarity  and  cooperation  in securing equitable access to COVID- vaccines. It is an indictment on humanity that more than  per cent of the world’s vaccine doses have been  acquired  by  wealthy  countries,  while  less  than  one  per  cent  has  gone  to  low-income countries.  Unless we address this as a matter of urgency, the pandemic will last much longer and new mutations of the virus will emerge.  South Africa reaffirms its call for fair and equitable distribution of vaccines.  We urge all member states to support the proposal for a temporary waiver of certain provisions of  the  Agreement  on  Trade-Related  Aspects  of  Intellectual  Property  Rights  to  allow  more countries, particularly low- and middle-income countries, to produce COVID- vaccines. In this interconnected world, no country is safe until every country is safe.  We need to prepare now for future pandemics and work with greater determination towards the goal of universal health coverage. In  the  wake  of  the  COVID-  pandemic,  we  must  increase  investment  towards  the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals by providing low-income countries with the means of implementation.                In  this  respect,  the  G20  Debt  Standstill  Initiative  is  a  welcome  response  to  the  fiscal  and liquidity challenges faced by least developed economies.  Check Against Delivery  The agreement on the allocation of $650 billion in Special Drawing Rights is significant, but it is insufficient to meet the extent of the need. South Africa therefore reiterates its call for % of the total allocation, amounting to around $162 billion, to be made available to the African continent. Mr President, Climate change is an existential crisis for the entire world, yet poor countries are particularly vulnerable. Although  we  bear  the  least  responsibility  for  causing  climate  change,  African  countries  are among those that carry the greatest cost. For the forthcoming COP  in Glasgow to respond adequately to the crisis we face, we need to  see  greater  ambition  and  progress  on  mitigation,  adaptation  and  the  means  of implementation.  COP26  must  therefore  launch  a  formal  programme  of  work  on  the  implementation  of  the Global Goal on Adaptation. The pandemic has been a stark reminder of our mutual dependency, and that instability in one region of the world inevitably impacts its neighbours.  That is why we seek to enhance the relationship between the UN and the African Union in maintaining peace, financing peacebuilding efforts, and advancing post-conflict reconstruction and development.                  South Africa continues with its efforts to contribute to international peace and security through our  membership  of  the  Peacebuilding  Commission  and  our  continued  engagement  in  UN Check Against Delivery  peacekeeping.  The  right  of  the  Palestinian  people  to  self-determination  has  been  raised  in  this  General Assembly for almost as long as this body has been in existence. We  raise  it  again  today,  not  because  we  are  bound  by  practice  to  do  so,  but  because  we resolutely believe that there shall be no peace and no justice until the Palestinian people are free from occupation and are able to exercise the rights for which this United Nations stands. We have a responsibility, as the nations of the world, to spare no effort in finding a just, lasting and peaceful solution based on internationally agreed parameters enshrined in the relevant UN resolutions.  We  reiterate  our  position  that  the  people  of  Western  Sahara  have  the  right  to  self-determination  in  line  with  the  relevant  African  Union  decisions  and  UN  Security  Council resolutions.  South Africa further affirms its solidarity with the Cuban people and calls for the lifting of the economic embargo that has caused untold damage to the country’s economy and people.  Mr President, This year marks  years since the start of the Inter-Governmental Negotiations process and  years since the World Summit of 2005, where world leaders unanimously agreed on early reform of the Security Council.  We have not honoured this undertaking.  South Africa reiterates its call for urgent reform and a move to text-based negotiations through which an agreement can ultimately be reached.                We  must  address  the  under-representation  of  the  African  continent  in  the  UN  system,  and ensure  that  the  voice  of  the  African  continent  and  of  the  Global  South  in  general  is strengthened in the multilateral system.  Check Against Delivery  Concurrent  with  achieving  equitable  geographical  representation  in  the  UN  we  must  also address the question of gender parity. Yesterday,  we  marked  the  20th  anniversary  of  the  adoption  of  the  Durban  Declaration  and Programme of Action at the World Conference against Racism in South Africa. This remains the international community’s blueprint for action to fight racism and other forms of intolerance. We  are  bound  by  a  common  responsibility  to  fight  both  the  legacy  of  past  racism  and  the manifestation in the present. Racism, like sexism, xenophobia and homophobia, demeans us all. It undermines our humanity and stifles our efforts to build a world rooted in tolerance, respect and human rights. Let  us  use  this  anniversary  to  renew  our  commitment  to  combatting  racism,  racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance wherever they are found. Mr President, The challenges we face are immense. We have to drive the global recovery.  We have to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.  We have to advance gender equality and the empowerment of women.                    We have to address climate change, maintain peace and security, and protect society’s most Check Against Delivery  vulnerable.  Above all, we must close the wounds of poverty, inequality and underdevelopment that are preventing societies from realising their full potential.  This can only be done within the framework of a revitalised and reformed multilateral system, with a strong, capable United Nations at its centre.  At this defining moment, this General Assembly of the nations of the world is once again being called upon to inspire, to guide and to lead.  The UN stands as a beacon of hope for all who dream of a better world.  Let us, together, with the United Nations as our instrument, write a new history for humankind – one of equality, freedom, fundamental rights and shared prosperity for all. Leaving no-one behind I thank you.             "
20,2021,CPV,Cabo Verde,"President of the Republic Mr. Jorge Carlos de Almeida Fonseca, in the General Debate of the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, under the theme: ""Building resilience through hope - to recover from COVID-, rebuild sustainability, respond to the needs of the planet, respect people's rights and revitalize the United Nations"". - New York, September , 2021 – Ladies and Gentlemen Heads of State and Government  Mr. Abdulla Shahid, President of the General Assembly Mr. Antnio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ladies and Gentlemen, Heads of Delegation, Excellencies, International relations, diplomacy in general, the major world and United Nations  conferences  in  particular,  have  accustomed  us  to  traditional meetings  marked  by  the  uniqueness  of  physical  presence  and  effusion among participants.  Face-to-face  meetings,  handshakes,  hugs,  dialogues  in  the  halls, negotiations in bilateral or small committees have always been the soul      of these meetings of the International Community, which were left behind almost  two  years  ago  due  to  the  mandatory  use  of  online  and  digital communications. The fact that we are meeting  in person on the occasion of  the General Debate  of  this  76th    Session  of  the  General  Assembly  should  be interpreted  as  a  sign  of  our  collective  determination  to  do  everything possible to overcome the scourge of the COVID  pandemic, on the path to better reconstruction and a more resilient world. Ladies and Gentlemen Excellencies, It is in this positive spirit that I begin my speech, greeting, on behalf of the  People  of  Cabo  Verde,  all  the  other  Peoples  of  the  United  Nations represented  here  by  their  highest  dignitaries,  with  wishes  for  progress and well-being for all.  I would like to present my tribute to Mr. Volkan Bozkir, from Turkey, the outgoing  President  of  the  General  Assembly,  for  the  way  in  which  he performed his duties amidst the difficulties that we all know.  I  welcome  the  election  of  Mr.  Abdulla  Shahid  as  President  of  the  76th Session of the General Assembly and I am pleased that, him being from the Maldives and the sixth President from a Small Island Developing State like  Cabo  Verde,  it  is  a  sign  of  inclusion  of  our  multilateral  system.  I further  congratulate  the  President-elect  for  having  chosen  hope  as  the symbol of his presidency. In our history, in Cabo Verde, we have always     chosen the optimism of hope against the pessimism of resignation. And in fact, today, in the face of the exponential pandemic challenge we face, hope is the way, especially if we know how to act quickly, together and in solidarity. I also address my most cordial greetings and words of appreciation to the Secretary General and my dear friend, Antnio Guterres. First, because, halfway through the previous session, he ended his first mandate with honors  for  having  accomplished  and,  above  all,  for  having  been  a champion  in  mobilizing  the  United  Nations  and  the  world  in  the  fight against  the  pandemic  and  its  devastating  effects,  particularly  in defending  the  unique  need  for  universal  and  more  equitable  access  to vaccines against COVID . Secondly, I am glad for your re-election as a renewed  vote  of  confidence  from  the  United  Nations  community  to continue the work you have done so far. Finally, I congratulate you on the  publication,  on  September  ,  of  an  excellent  report  entitled  ""Our Common Agenda"", with which you inaugurate your second mandate.  More than responding to what was asked of him, in the sense of guiding the  responses  to  the  commitments  of  the  Declaration  of  the  75th anniversary of the United Nations, the Secretary General, in this proposal of a Common Agenda, offers us his vision of the future of the world and the role of the United Nations in that context. A future that depends on our collective choice of continuing down the path of destruction caused by  COVID  ,  climate  change  and  the  erosion  of  human  rights,  or  the option  of  resuming  the  ascent  to  progress,  inclusion,  environmental   sustainability  and  our  development,  including  through  an  effective United Nations system that gives meaning to multilateralism.  Let me tell you, Mr. Secretary General, that Cabo Verde has no doubts about the future it wants. That is why you can count on our country in this journey, in particular, aiming at the goals you want to undertake and finding the solutions you want to achieve, with your proposal to hold the ""Summit of the Future"", as you recommend in "" Our Common Agenda"", namely, ""to forge a new global consensus on what our future should look like and how we can ensure it"". Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, Cabo  Verde  is  a  small  island  country,  scattered  across  the  Atlantic Sahelian belt. It is also a great nation, combining the resident population and  its vast diaspora, spread across the four corners of the world, but with the heart planted in Cabo Verde.  After  the  historical  period  of  dependence,  slavery  and  colonization, independence gave us the hope of being able to make our own choices, placing this responsibility primarily in our own hands. To support us in this  process,  we  chose  the  paths  of  multilateralism,  international cooperation, and strategic partnerships for our dynamic insertion in the global  world.  We  have  chosen,  also  on  this  path  that  has  led  us  to democracy for thirty years, good governance  based on the Rule of Law,     Peace, Security, the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, Gender Parity and Inclusion, and the Fight against Poverty and Inequality.      In that line of progress, in 2008 we graduated from the list of the least advanced countries to a middle-income country. We achieved most of the Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  in  2015,  as  well  as  made  our choice to align with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and to that end, we adopted the Strategic Sustainable Development Plan (SDSP).  The emergence of COVID  pandemic, especially its health, economic, and social impact, in a brutal way, has deconstructed the economy that had been growing at about %, attacking the mainstays sectors such as tourism, transportation, and domestic demand, causing the lack of social protection,  unemployment,  and  increased  poverty;  deregulating  the fundamentals  of  the  macro  economy,  such  as  inflation,  budget  deficit, debt,  and  a  plummeting  economic  growth,  in  short,  generating  a recession never before experienced, translating into a .% reduction.    My country did not react with resignation, but with determination, taking all of the internationally recommended anti-crisis measures immediately and in the short term.  For the medium and long term, we carried out a participatory  strategic  planning  exercise  to  define  a  common  vision  for 2030, entitled Cabo Verde Ambition 2030, in order to resume the process of sustainable development and to better rebuild from the lessons learned and  opportunities  that  emerged  from  the  crisis,  including  in  terms  of access to concessional financing and attracting foreign direct investment, which continue to be the greatest obstacles in this direction.     As mentioned in the PEDS and Ambition 2030 documents, Cabo Verde's purposes are to strengthen its alignment  with the values and interests defended  by  multilateralism  and  a  rules-based  world  order,  with  an effective United Nations at its center. Such purposes require Cabo Verde's continuous  affirmation  as  a  safe  country  and  a  useful  and  credible partner in the performance of a diplomacy up to the new challenges of the world in which it is inserted. At the present juncture, Cabo Verde's first priority is to fight the Covid- pandemic. Important and consistent gains have been registered, both in the reduction of transmission rates and in the vaccination rate of the eligible  population,  which  has  already  reached  %,  with  at  least  one dose,  and  our  goal  is  to  reach  %,  of  the  eligible  population,  fully immunized, by the end of October of this year.  This success would not have been possible without the perseverance and determination that characterize the Cabo Verdean leaders and people, as well  as  the  strengthening  of  the  worldwide  solidarity  of  all  partners, namely the COVAX. Our warmest thanks to all. The  economic  recovery  remains,  in  parallel,  an  important  priority  for Cabo  Verde,  mainly  through  the  recovery  of  the  tourism  sector  and related economies. The reciprocal recognition of vaccination certificates and the revision of travel  warnings are measures that Cabo Verde has been  working  on  with  public  and  private  partners,  and  international guidelines in this regard can only support and encourage the return of tourism.     Excellencies,  Ladies and Gentlemen, Cabo  Verde  has  structurally  all  the  characteristics  of  a  Small  Island Developing State (SIDS), namely the physical smallness and dispersion in islands, immersion in large oceanic spaces and remoteness from major markets  that  weaken  its  economic  base,  accentuate  its  exposure  to climate change and other environmental phenomena such as drought, as well  as  reduce  resilience  to  natural  phenomena  and  other  external shocks.  Within this framework, the manifestations and impact of COVID ,  only  exacerbated  the  pre-existing  conditions,  making  the  SIDS  the most affected by the pandemic. Cabo Verde is a member, within the United Nations, of the Association of Small Island States (AOSIS), which has been advocating for SIDS, global and differentiated international support measures, recommended since the Rio Conference in 1992. In this context, the study, debate and the desirable  adoption  by international  consensus  of  the  so-called Multidimensional  Vulnerability  Index  (MVI)  applicable  to  SIDS,  with respect  to  the  three  dimensions  of  sustainable  development,  that  is economic, social and environmental, should be able to help both in the classification of the level of development of each one, and in the eligibility to  such  differentiated  support  measures,  thus  allowing  the  effective implementation of the commitments established in the SAMOA Pathway.    SIDS,  in  each  of  the  three  geographic  regions  of  insertion,  from  the Pacific, the Caribbean, and around Africa to Southeast Asia, have sectors    that  offer  opportunities  for  economic  growth  in  areas  of  natural resources, tourism, and the blue economy, among others. Measures to support  growth  and  economic  competitiveness  in  such  growth  areas, support  for  climate  adaptation  and  resilience  building,  facilities  to support direct investment and general and climate finance, are examples of measures that should be taken globally towards SIDS and tailored to each in particular.   Finally,  SIDS,  their  problems,  challenges  and  solutions,  should  be present at the Future Summit announced by the Secretary General, as part  of  the  problems,  but  also  as  part  of  the  solutions.  And  the opportunity is offered to us to make decisions that meet the specificities and legitimate interests and aspirations of this group of countries, among the most vulnerable of the United Nations Family, leaving none behind. Excellencies,  Ladies and Gentlemen, The maintenance of international peace and security was at the core of the  creation  of  the  UN.  For  Cabo  Verde,  the  values  Liberty,  Peace, Democracy and Political Stability are fundamental to building more just, peaceful and inclusive societies.  In  the  face  of  global  challenges,  we  are  increasingly  aware  of  the imperative of this fundamental objective of the Peoples  who signed the Charter  of  the  United  Nations.  We  are  also  aware  that  the  political instability  plaguing  the  most  diverse  regions  and  the  insecurity    aggravated by violent extremism and transnational crime are barriers to development and peaceful coexistence among nations. The desired effective performance of the United Nations requires regular and  consistent  reforms  of  its  main  bodies.  We  recognize  the  progress achieved so far with the reforms in its development pillar, making the UN System more efficient. Progressive and innovative has been the process of revitalizing the General Assembly, allowing it to be more pragmatic in its deliberations. We  also  understand  that  the  revitalization  of  the  UN  goes  through  the need for a reform of the Security Council, which can give a greater range of Member States in decision making related to international peace and security. As a member of the African Union,  Cabo Verde subscribes to the Ezulwini consensus. Ladies and Gentlemen Heads of State and Government  Mr. Abdulla Shahid, President of the General Assembly Mr. Antnio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ladies and Gentlemen, Heads of Delegation, Excellencies,        The  history  of  the  world  has  been  a  succession  of  crises  and  new opportunities for progress, looking towards the future.   With the ongoing crisis caused by the pandemic of COVID , we have often  reflected  and  pointed  out  that  it  is  also  a  crisis  of  opportunity, challenging both the present and future generations with responsibility, young people first and foremost. As a crisis, the pandemic has destroyed lives, compromised health care, disrupted economies and social protection systems, reduced educational and  employment  opportunities  for  youth,  and  increased  poverty  and inequality, exposing the most fragile more to the effects of climate change and weakening them further.   But  we  have  also  witnessed  the  opportunities  that  have  arisen  from fighting the Pandemic, or arising from the search for solutions, with the use  of  technologies  to  minimize  the  effects  of  physical  distance  in communication,  administration,  education,  entertainment,  diplomatic practice and business, to monitor the advance of transmission, the role of science in its race to obtain a vaccine in record time, in the multiple forms of creativity and adaptation and response to the present time, in many other fields of activity. However, the COVID  crisis is also part of a chain of other crises such as  climate  change,  geopolitical  conflicts,  and  criminal  insecurity,  and their interconnectedness results in an accentuation of the gap between the haves and have-nots, both nationally and internationally, particularly with regard to access to the vaccine for all and the financial conditions and means to rebuild better.    The  missing  link  between  crisis  and  opportunity  lies  in  the  exercise  of greater global solidarity to make real possible solutions that can build the ""Future we want"" as well as  the ""United Nations we need"". For both to happen or not, the action of any State, individually, will not be enough, but  both  perfectly  achievable,  through  collective  action  or  the  vast majority.  ""The Future we want"" was always inscribed in the United Nations Charter through the goals aiming at  (more) Peace  and Security, Protection and Promotion  of  Human  Rights  and  International  Cooperation  for  the achievement of economic, social and cultural progress for all, depending on the effective implementation of these same goals.   On  the  other  hand,  the  ""United  Nations  we  need""  has  always  been  a debate  between  what  it  should  do  and  what  the  Organization  can,  in effect, deliver, the difference lying in collective action that can bring power as close as possible to duty.  The results achieved so far by the  United Nations System could be vastly increased or improved in all areas, from sustained Peace to sustainable Development.  The  ""Future  we  want""  for  this  depends  on  our  ability  to  seize  the opportunities born of the pending crises.  The Way forward is multilateralism, revisited and strengthened, to meet today's great challenges, and the venue for this new beginning may well be the Future Summit.     Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen,  Allow me, before I conclude, to make a more personal statement.  As I am at the end of my second mandate and my country is due to hold presidential  elections  on  October  ,  this  is  the  last  time  I  will  appear before you, in this Great Assembly, as President of the Republic of Cabo Verde.  I will keep the best memories of this United Nations House, and I would like  to  reiterate  here  my  total  commitment  to  continue  defending  and promoting,  with  you,  the  inalienable  values  of  Freedom,  Democracy, Human Rights and Peace!  Thank you very much. Jorge Carlos de Almeida Fonseca     "
21,2021,GMB,Gambia,
22,2021,GHA,Ghana,"President, I congratulate you warmly on your assumption of office as President of the General Assembly, the Assembly of humanity, and wish you  well  in  the  management  of  our  affairs.  I  congratulate  also  the Secretary-General on his unanimous re-election for a second term. The Common  Agenda  that  he  has  outlined  provides  us  with  a  powerful framework  within  which  to  tackle  effectively  global  issues  in  these  first decades of the 21st century. The presence here, in New York, of one hundred and two (102) leaders of nations, in this 76th Session, tells us of our resolve to return the world to  normalcy.  We  are  not  there  yet,  but  we  are  making  considerable progress.  Back in 2017, when I made my first appearance at the General Assembly as  a  newly elected President  of  Ghana, I said neither  Ghana  nor  Africa wanted  to  be  scars  on  anybody’s  conscience.  I  said  we  want  to  build economies that are not dependent on charity and handouts, because long and bitter experiences have taught us that, no matter how generous the charity, we would remain poor. Between 2017 to 2020, Ghana recorded an average growth rate of %, amongst the highest in the world. In 2020, when the global economy and sub-Saharan Africa’s contracted by .% and .%, respectively, Ghana was one of the few countries that produced a positive growth rate. This is a testament to our determination to build a Ghana Beyond Aid.  One year on, although infection rates and deaths are relatively lower in the  Region,  the  virus's  impact  on  economies  and  livelihoods  has  been damaging.  The  latest  numbers  from  the  African  Development  Bank indicate that African economies, which contracted by .% in 2020, are yet to return to pre-pandemic levels. More than thirty million Africans fell        into extreme poverty in 2020, and nearly forty million could do so in 2021. The  social  impact  has  been  devastating;  over  one  hundred  and  three million African jobs have been lost. Women, who account for forty percent (%) of total employment, have been most hard hit. Mr.  President,  we  are  listening  to  the  scientists:  it  is  evident  that vaccination is the way to protect populations, and revitalise societies. To vaccinate seventy percent (%) in the shortest possible time, as is being done elsewhere in the world, means some nine hundred million Africans have to be vaccinated. The Afreximbank’s structuring of the Africa Vaccine Acquisition  Taskforce's  two-billion-dollar  acquisition  of  four  hundred million Johnson & Johnson vaccines is part of the historic African Union's COVID-  Vaccine  Development  and  Access  Strategy.  It  is  a  critical milestone  in  our  collective  fight  against  the  pandemic,  in  a  continent suffering  the  worst  brunt  of  vaccine  nationalism.  The  Africa  Vaccine Acquisition Taskforce vaccine programme, partly manufactured in South Africa, is the single largest and most far-reaching trade transaction since the entry into force of the African Continental Free Trade Area in January this year. It is eloquent testimony to the benefits of domestic production and  pooled  procurement  in  Africa,  as  envisioned  by  the  African Continental Free Trade Area Agreement.  Ghana agrees with the call of the Rome Declaration of Global Health for voluntary licensing and technology transfers to boost vaccine production. The Africa Union is working with WHO, WTO and other global partners to expand its vaccine manufacturing and deployment. We, in Ghana, have, so far, received five million doses, which have been administered  to  frontline  health  workers  and  those  classified  as  being most at risk. Five million is not a figure to be sneered at, particularly when we consider the situation in many other African countries. We are grateful that  our  efforts  at  the  management  of  the  pandemic  and  vaccine distribution have been recognised, and we have received these amounts so far. We are still hoping to vaccinate twenty million of our people by the end of the year.  One unfortunate development appears to be the recent measures on entry into some countries in Europe, which suggest that Covishield, the Oxford-AstraZeneca  vaccine  manufactured  in  India, is  not  recognised  by  these countries. What is intriguing is the fact that this vaccine was donated to       African countries through the COVAX facility. The use of vaccines as a tool for immigration control will be a truly regressive step. Mr President, the last time there was such an upheaval in the world was during the Second World War, which led to the establishment of a new world order. This organisation, the United Nations, and the other Bretton Woods  institutions  were  created  to  maintain  international  peace  and security,  help  rebuild  the  shattered  post-war  economy,  and  promote global economic cooperation.  Even before the pandemic outbreak, many had concluded that the current structure of global economic co-operation, designed some seventy-seven ()  years  ago,  has  proven  inadequate  to  finance  infrastructure  and economic transformation in developing countries. Given the incapacity of the global financial system to produce the necessary outcomes to finance sustainable  development,  we  need  a  constructive  review.  COVID- provides a great chance to rethink global economic co-operation, based on  the  principles  of  mutuality,  equity,  sustainability,  and  collective prosperity envisaged by the SDGs.    There is no question but that, if the famous gathering in San Francisco was to take place today, it would be a significantly different United Nations Charter that would be written. In much the same way, a World Bank or IMF or WHO, that is born today, would be radically different institutions from those that were set up after the World War, as many of the countries in today’s world, especially in Africa and the Caribbean, were not present in San Francisco.  The pandemic has also shown us that, the great advances in science and technology notwithstanding, we still have a lot to learn and discover about the human body and about life. Thus far, in spite of the grisly predictions of dead bodies littering the streets of Africa, and in spite of not having had  as  much  access  to  vaccines  as  the developed  world,  Africa  seems, mercifully, to have escaped the worst of the COVID death rates. And, for that, we thank God.  Ghana wants to share a few thoughts, which, we believe, should form the basis for the new global co-operation. Firstly, we need to strengthen the funding of the existing global health organisations.  This  must  include  a  greater,  more  predictable  base  of         multilateral funding for WHO and Regional Centres of Disease Controls, which  play  the  central  roles  in  global  health  security.  It  will  require dedicating  an  additional  one  percent  (%)  of  GDP  to  funding  global health. This is an investment in a global public good, not aid.  Secondly, we must develop more resilient finances to build back better, and for future preparedness.  Across the African continent, revenues have decreased  by  as  much  as  one  hundred  and  fifty  billion  dollars  ($150 billion),  as  economies  are  still  reeling  from  the  economic  impact  of  the pandemic.  African  governments  have  already  spent  scarce  reserves fighting  the  pandemic,  and  providing  social  protection  to  millions  of affected  households.  Ghana  has  been  advocating  that  innovative financing must also address structural challenges beyond responding to immediate fiscal needs, by providing mechanisms to facilitate investments in  health  infrastructure,  technology,  the  environment,  and  people  that would bolster resilience and equitable recovery. The IMF's unprecedented six hundred-and-fifty-billion-dollar ($650 billion) SDR allocation offers a unique opportunity to provide additional financial resources  to  address  the  vast  and  surging  inequities  the  pandemic  has revealed,  and  a  crisis  to  come.  Africa’s  allocation  is  some  thirty-three billion dollars ($ billion). If there was ever a time for an African Marshall Plan,  it  is  now!  The  SDR  infusion  should  be  seized  upon  as  a  catalytic effort  to  leapfrog  Africa  to  the  next  level  of  human  development,  and ensure sustained global prosperity. African leaders have advocated for a prudent and transparent channelling of twenty-five to thirty-five percent (%-%) of SDRs, that is one hundred and sixty to two hundred and thirty billion dollars, from wealthier to vulnerable countries, one hundred billion dollars  ($100 billion) of which should be  dedicated to  Africa.  We welcome the support of the European countries represented at the Africa Summit in France, the IMF, the G7 and G20, to some SDR redistribution. Mr  President,  proceeds  of  channelled  SDRs  should  fund  vaccine acquisition and manufacturing, climate and green investments, and a pan-African Stability Mechanism, like the European Stability Mechanism, that would  safeguard  financial  stability  on  the  continent.  A  part  of  the redistribution  should  also  help  fund  the  recapitalisation  of  the  African Development Bank and Afreximbank to support industrialisation, private-sector job creation and the African Continental Free Trade initiative.       Thirdly,  we  must  re-position  key  multilateral  organisations  and international  financial institutions such as the United  Nations, the other Bretton Woods Institutions, and the G20 to reflect inclusiveness, support country  investments  in  global  public  goods,  and  ensure  fast-tracked financial support to build back better, and prepare for future pandemics. For  instance,  the  key  to  the  G20's  effectiveness  is  that  it  achieves representative  coverage  of  the  global  population  and  economy  with  a diversified enough number of leaders at the table, to enable speed and flexibility in deliberation and decision-making.  Admitting  the African  Union to an expanded G21 would have the same galvanising effect within Africa that the EU's participation in the G20 has within  Europe, strengthening policy co-ordination  and coherence  across the fifty-four () African economies. With the African Union at the table, the  group  suddenly  would  have  representation  for  fifty-four  ()  more countries,  .  billion  more  people,  and  $.  trillion  more  output.  This extraordinary increase in representation will add just one seat to the table, and about ten minutes to the discussion. However, it will redefine global policy  co-ordination  to  enable  a  more  prosperous,  inclusive  and sustainable world to emerge. Fourthly,  we,  in  Africa,  are  as  committed  as  any  to  the  fight  against Climate Change. We believe, however, that the fight is better-advanced if we are able to maintain the crucial balance between economic, political and environmental imperatives – positions that we will be articulating in Glasgow, at the COP  Conference, which should form part of the new Global Compact. Lastly, now  more  than ever, we must defend democracy,  constitutional rule and human rights in the world. In the last twenty-four () months, we have witnessed assaults on democracy around the world, sometimes even in developed countries where we had assumed that a consensus on the democratic form of governance had been established. Mr.  President,  in  West  Africa,  recent  events  in  Mali  and  Guinea  have undermined democratic governance in our Region. ECOWAS, the regional body  whose  Authority  I  have  the  honour  to  be  the  current  Chair,  is unreservedly  committed  to  maintaining  democratic  governance  in  the ECOWAS  Community.  That  is  why  both  Guinea  and  Mali,  foundation members of the Community, have been suspended from its organisation,       pending  the  restoration  of  democratic  governance.  We  welcome  the support of the United Nations for the measures taken. ECOWAS  has given Guinea six () months  to do so, and requested the immediate release of President Alpha Conde. On my visit to Conakry last Friday,  the  military  leaders  indicated  their  willingness  to  see  to  his imminent release, and it is our hope that they will keep to their word. The Authority has also made it clear to the military government in Mali, that it is not prepared to negotiate an extension to the February deadline for the holding of democratic elections, as the essential steps to be taken can, with political will, be effected within the ECOWAS-sanctioned timetable. It is better that a government, with a democratic mandate, be in place as soon  as  possible,  to  implement  the  necessary  reforms  for  the  future stability  and  growth  of  Mali,  thereby  enhancing  capacity  for  the  all-important fight against terrorism in Mali and in the wider Sahel.   We, in Ghana, highly resolve that we will continue to defend democracy and  constitutional  rule,  and  uphold  human  rights.  We  shall  work  to strengthen the institutions that support democracy in our country and in our Region.      We shall continue to support the United Nations and other international organisations to help remind us that, indeed, no man is an island, entire of itself.  I thank you for your attention.                    "
23,2021,GNB,Guinea-Bissau,
24,2021,LBR,Liberia,"President of the Seventy-sixth Session of the United Nations General Assembly; and avail to him Liberia’s fullest support in the fulfillment of his duties and responsibilities.  I also wish to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Volkan Bozkir; for his distinguished stewardship in steering the affairs of the 75th Session of the General Assembly. Let me also congratulate His Excellency Mr. Antnio Guterres on his election for a second term as Secretary General of the United Nations, which begins on January , 2022.   Mr. Secretary-General, I commend and thank you for your continued diligence and commitment to the work of the United Nations, and for ably steering its affairs, even in the face of unprecedented challenges.  EXCELLENCIES, DISTINGUISHED LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: The negative socio-economic impacts and health consequences of the COVID- pandemic remind us of the measure of work that is required at the global and national level to combat this pestilence.  This is reflected in the theme for this 76th Session: “Building resilience through hope to recover from COVID-, rebuild sustainably, respond to the needs of the planet, respect the rights of people, and revitalize the United Nations”                    The Theme is a clarion call to all peoples of all nations, that as we try to re-build our Covid-impeded economies, we must do so in a sustainable manner that will take due account of our environment, and have due regard for the fundamental human rights which are enshrined in the Charter of this noble institution.  Meanwhile, it is important that we pay heartfelt tribute to the courageous and dedicated public health workers around the world for their continued selfless service in the fight against the COVID- pandemic.  The world owes to them a debt of gratitude.  EXCELLENCIES, DISTINGUISHED LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: The Theme of this General Assembly also calls for a revitalization of the United Nations to make it more relevant and effective in the true fulfillment of its mandate in a changing world.  This is a task that has been recognized as an imperative priority by successive previous leaders and members of the Organization in recent times. Six years ago, and true to the ideals and principles of its Charter, the United Nations General Assembly took a giant step forward to promote the economic and social advancement of all peoples, and to better their standards of living, when it adopted the landmark 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.  This was meant to be a global plan of action; for people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnership; with the goal of eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions. However; since our transition to the Decade of Action for the implementation of the new Sustainable Development Goals,  the world has been engulfed by a global pandemic which has posed enormous strains on our capacity to implement the 2030 Agenda, and has even raised the possibility of reversing development gains. In order to build resilience through hope, we must continue to emphasize the need for attention and support to vulnerable societies and developing countries; particularly, the Least Developed Countries.  Sustainable recovery from the pandemic must be based on the principle of inclusiveness and solidarity; and within the context of leaving no one behind. Addressing the particular needs of the Least Developed Countries could significantly contribute to recovery.  Support for the upcoming Fifth Conference on Least Developed Countries (LDC-), to be held in Doha, Qatar in January 2022;  and the new Program of Action for Least Developed Countries for the coming decade, will also provide the basis for sustainable recovery, and the timely implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.                MR. PRESIDENT, DISTINGUISHED DELEGATES: Permit me; on behalf of the Government and People of the Republic of Liberia, to extend deep appreciation to all our bilateral, multilateral, development, regional, sub-regional, national and local partners; for their support in our fight against the COVID- pandemic, and the assistance they continue to provide in our quest towards recovery.  In response to the pandemic, my Government, in line with our National Development Plan; “The Pro-Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development” (PADP), has developed a Post-COVID- Economic Recovery Plan.   This Plan aims to reduce the impact of the pandemic by providing the basis for economic recovery through short term actions, and investments in key sectors, including agriculture and tourism.  Under the Economic Recovery Plan, the Liberian economy is already beginning to show signs of resurgence, and in spite of the negative impact of the coronavirus, projections for GDP growth is now positive, and is expected to reach four (%) percent in the coming year.   Through the implementation of difficult macroeconomic reforms, my Government has been able to obtain a substantial increase in domestic revenue generation for the first time in more than a decade, and we are committed to broader economic and investment climate reforms. In the agriculture sector for example, my Government is endeavoring to vigorously launch agricultural promotion projects, which will increase agricultural production through new entrepreneurship opportunities, innovations, and safe farming techniques.Moreover, conscious of the importance and impact of infrastructure on social and economic development, as enshrined in the PAPD, my Government has identified investment in roads; energy and ports as key priority areas. EXCELLENCIES, DISTINGUISHED LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: A further reflection on the theme for this year’s General Assembly highlights the necessity to respond to the needs of our planet. The reality of climate change facing our planet demands the urgent attention and collective action of all national and international actors. We have all observed the extension of deserts and recurrent droughts in Eastern and Southern Africa; the increasing intensity and frequency of storms and floods in our region; the alarming rise in the levels of the world’s oceans due to the meltdown of the Arctic; and the frequency and size of forest fires that destroy thousands of acres of arable lands and properties. These conditions threaten our survival as inhabitants of this precious earth.              In this regard, the recent re-entry into the Paris Accord by the United States of America is a decision that my Government wholeheartedly welcomes and applauds, as we believe that this manifests and demonstrates the critical leadership needed to mobilize global coordinated action. In the same vein, it is noteworthy that the President of the United States of America, in a recent nationwide address to the American People on the devastation caused by Hurricane Ida, called for immediate and urgent action to combat and reverse global warming trends. For far too long, we state actors, including those on my own continent who have faced the harshest extremes of weather and climate, have been guilty of window-dressing climate issues with rhetorics and passive declarations.  Liberia humbly submits to this august body that now is the time for concerted and decisive action. Liberia, for its part, reaffirms our commitment to continue our good stewardship of our critical ecosystem of tropical rainforest, coastal mangroves and interior peatlands.   Our recently completed National Forest Inventory carried out with the support of the World Bank and the Kingdom of Norway, revealed that Liberia is endowed with nearly seven () million hectares of forest, representing nearly half of the entire remaining Upper Guinea forest in the West Africa region. If you add to this our . million hectares of agro-forestry and coastal mangroves, it becomes obvious that close to ninety (%) percent of our landmass sequesters carbon. Our forests are the last remaining untouched tracts of forested land in this region and contain some of the highest above-ground carbon stocks of any forest in the world, even higher than the carbon stocks in the great Amazonian Forest.  As one of the last reserves of such high carbon stocks, it is imperative that Liberia’s forests are maintained in the future. My government reiterates its commitment to do so.  Nevertheless, we know that many of the highest carbon stock forests in Liberia contain essential natural capital and ecosystem service benefits; benefits which have so far eluded us as a developing nation. Liberia has a youthful population and faces enormous pressures for rapid development that provides decent jobs and livelihoods, especially in our productive sectors of agriculture and mining.  Our economy needs to develop, and we want to do so sustainably. We want to continue to maintain our forest and ecosystem endowments, and our incredible bio-diversity, as we embrace climate-smart approaches to agriculture and mining, which are our economic mainstays.    However, in order to do so, Liberia needs meaningful partnerships on this journey of sustainable development; partnerships with the United States, as well as with the rest of the developed world, including the private sector, to allow           us to leave our forests intact because of their extraordinary capacity to capture carbon for the benefit of the industrial world.   We are therefore looking forward to constructive engagements with all interested parties in this regard. The impending United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) will provide yet another opportunity to generate more ambitious climate actions and commitments.  EXCELLENCIES, DISTINGUISHED LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: Cognizant of the fact that growth and development is always enhanced by the existence of peace and security, my Government remains committed to the sustenance of democracy, the rule of law, and the consolidation and maintenance of peace and security in Liberia. We remain resolute and steadfast in this commitment. We thank the United Nations for its continued effort to maintain peace around the world.  With deep gratitude, we want to thank you, as well as the African Union, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the Mano River Union, and all our International Partners and Friends, for providing the support for the peace we continue to enjoy in Liberia.  We will continue to rely on that support in enhancing our capability to maintain peace in our Land. EXCELLENCIES, DISTINGUISHED LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: After the brutal civil war that ravished our country and divided our people for more than  years, and which finally ended just over two decades ago, it is important to agree on a process that would bring closure to the wounds of the victims, and thereby guarantee the sustenance of peace, stability, justice, and national reconciliation. As I have mentioned during my previous address to this body, my Government has already begun consultations with our National Legislature – the representatives of our people - in this regard.   Today, we can report significant progress in that we have already received a submission and recommendations from the Liberian Senate, which is the Upper House of our national Legislature.            We are now awaiting a similar submission from the Honorable House of Representatives, after which it is our further intention to have a wider engagement with the Liberian Judicial System, and with our strategic International Partners and Organizations. It is my hope that at the end of this consultative process, a National Consensus will evolve that will determine the pathway to resolving this issue.   In the meantime, we continue to encourage our citizens to utilize the Palaver Hut method, where perpetrators and victims can meet in traditional community forums to resolve their issues and their differences.   This is in keeping with one of the major recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that was established at the end of the civil conflict. MR. PRESIDENT, EXCELLENCIES, ESTEEMED DELEGATES, DISTINGUISHED LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: Let me reiterate that the way forward to a resilient post-Covid recovery must begin by ensuring that our interventions will be guided by the 2030 Agenda; ensuring affordable access to vaccines, testing and treatments on an equitable and inclusive basis; and strengthening the capacity of developing countries, particularly, the Least Developed Countries, so that no one is left behind as we strive to achieve the timely implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.  These important and critical objectives can best be realized and accelerated through improved partnership and increased solidarity among all Member States. I thank you.           "
25,2021,NGA,Nigeria,"President, Let me, on behalf of the government and people of Nigeria, congratulate you on  your  well-deserved  election  as  President  of  the  76th  Session  of  the  United Nations  General  Assembly.  I  would  like  to  assure  you  of  the  full  support  and cooperation of the Nigerian delegation throughout your tenure.   . I  would  like  to  commend  your  predecessor,  His  Excellency,  Mr.  Volkan Boskir, for the many remarkable achievements recorded during his tenure, despite the challenges posed by the COVID- pandemic.  . Permit me to congratulate the Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, on his re-election and commend his strong commitment to making the UN more alive to its responsibilities.  . I  also  want  to  express  my  gratitude  to  him  for  re-appointing  Ms.  Amina Mohammed,  as  the  Deputy  Secretary  General  to  assist  him  in  discharging  his heavy responsibilities. Mr. President, . The theme of this year’s General Assembly – “Building resilience through hope - to recover from COVID-, rebuild sustainably, respond to the needs of  the  planet,  respect  the  rights  of  the  people,  and  revitalise  the  United Nations,  sums  up  our  common  desire  to  rescue  our  planet,  recover  our economies, and restore hope to all the peoples of the world.  H.E. President Muhammadu Buhari                                                                                                                                                                                                       Page  of                                                                                                      . In this regard, my delegation will continue to support the United Nations, as the indispensable forum for international cooperation and the cornerstone of the multilateral system, rooted in respect for international law, including international human rights law and predicated on a rules-based order. Mr. President,  .  I want to thank the international community for the concerted response to COVID-.  The  solidarity  and  drive  to  contain  the  first  truly  global  health emergency of our time is a pointer to the many things we can achieve if we work together.  .  On our part, Nigeria has made strenuous efforts to contain the virus and halt its deadly onslaught on our people. Our efforts have been rewarded with moderate success.  . At the outset, we recognised detection and contact tracing to be important tools in combating the virus. In this connection, from a mere four laboratories with testing and detection capacities, we ramped up the facilities to over 140 centres today.  .  Similarly, we built isolation centres and emergency hospitals wards in record time  all  over  the  country.  We  carry  out  genomic  sequencing  in  designated laboratories across the country with a view to detecting variants in circulation.  H.E. President Muhammadu Buhari                                                                                                                                                                                                       Page  of                                                                                                          . In addition, over ,000 health care workers have recently been trained on Infection, Prevention and Control measures with the support of various partners. Through  the  Nigerian  Centre  for  Disease  Control,  we  have  established   infectious  disease  treatment  centres  located  within  our  Teaching  Hospitals  and Federal Medical Centres. .  Nigeria remains grateful for the assistance received from our partners and friends all over the world. Vaccination is the key to our safe emergence from the pandemic. We fully support the COVAX initiative from which we have benefitted. We  also  thank  the  United  States  of  America,  Turkey,  India,  China,  European Union, and others for the vaccines provided.  .  Despite the acknowledgement however, I would like to reiterate my call for a fairer and more equitable distribution of vaccines to all countries so that, together, we  can  fight  and  contain  the  pandemic.  The  rising  wave  of  newer  and  more contagious strains, makes this even more urgent. No country can afford the socio-economic implications of prolonged shutdown. It is imperative to underscore that no one is safe until everyone is safe. Mr President,  .  Nigeria remains deeply concerned over the illicit trade, transfer, and circulation of small arms and light weapons. Their excessive accumulation and uncontrolled spread  in  many  regions  of  the  world  are  having  devastating  humanitarian  and socio-economic consequences, especially on the continent of Africa.  H.E. President Muhammadu Buhari                                                                                                                                                                                                       Page  of                                                                                                       . It is on this note that my delegation calls for the world wide application of the Arms  Trade  Treaty to  codify  accountability  in  conventional  arms  trade,  which  is critical  to  the  security  of  nations.  This  is  in  recognition  of  the  need  for  a  broad-based  global  partnership  in  the  on-going  battle  against  trans-border  crimes, including terrorism and piracy. Mr. President, .  We must deal not only with the symptoms of conflict but also the immediate causes that fuel conflicts in the first place. These include poor and undemocratic governance, human rights abuses, poverty, ignorance, injustice and inequalities.  .  There  are  no  easy  solutions  to  these  conditions.  They  require  long  term investments and more effective international cooperation. In this connection, my delegation  underscores  the  importance  of  promoting  peaceful,  unfettered,  and inclusive participation of states in global actions towards conflict prevention. This will facilitate the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable  Development and the African Union Agenda 2063.    In West Africa especially, our democratic gains of the past decades are now being eroded. The recent trend of unconstitutional takeover of power, sometimes in reaction to unilateral  changes  of  constitutions  by  some  leaders,  must  not  be  tolerated  by  the international community. Nigeria fully supports the efforts by ECOWAS to address this growing challenge and appreciates the support of both the African Union and the United Nations. In this regard, I would like to reiterate that as leaders of our individual Member-States we need to adhere to the constitutional provisions of our countries, particularly on term limits. This is one area that generates crisis and political tension in our sub-region.  Page  of  H.E. President Muhammadu Buhari                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Mr President, .  Nigeria  is  fully  committed  to  nuclear  non-proliferation  and  has  always supported the view that it should involve all States. .  Disarmament  Conventions  deserve  the  support  of  all  states,  small,  large, nuclear  or  non-nuclear.  Nuclear  weapons  remain  the  ultimate  agents  of  mass destruction,  and  their  total  elimination  should  be  the  final  objective  of  all disarmament processes within the broad spectrum of goals being pursued by the United Nations.  . In this regard, Nigeria would participate actively in the forthcoming Review Conference of the Nuclear Prohibition Treaty and also the First Meeting of States Parties to the landmark Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, scheduled to take place within the first quarter of 2022.  .  Nigeria  regards  these  upcoming  events  as  important  steps  towards  the realisation of a world free of nuclear weapons. We are, therefore, supportive of any diplomatic  efforts  in  this  direction.  We  hope  that  the  upcoming  NPT  review conference  would  lead  to  a  successful  outcome  that  would  facilitate  the denuclearisation of the world. We would do our part to ensure such an outcome. H.E. President Muhammadu Buhari                                                                                                                                                                                                       Page  of                                                                                                        Mr. President,  .  Terrorism  continues  to  dominate  security  discourse  worldwide.  In  Nigeria, Boko Haram terrorists group, though fragmented by internal strife and weakened by  our  defence  forces,  is  still  active  and  preying  on  soft  targets.  Nigeria  will continue to work closely with UN Counter-Terrorism bodies and entities with a view to bringing this scourge to an end. .  Nigeria has spared no effort in addressing the challenges of terrorism posed by the activities of Boko Haram in North-East Nigeria and the Lake Chad region, as  well  as  banditry  in  the  North-West  and  North-Central  Nigeria.  The  Nigerian Security Forces have recorded considerable success in the fight against terrorism. As  a  result  of  the  renewed  vigour  of  our  military,  many  terrorist  fighters  are voluntarily surrendering to our security forces.  . I and three other Nigerian Heads of State served actively as peace keepers and  Nigeria  continues  to  support  peacekeeping  efforts.  We  know  the  sacrifice involved,  we  also  know  how  important peace  keeping  is  for  those  in  vulnerable situations. Nigeria will continue to play its part fully in supporting United Nations peacekeeping operations within Africa and beyond. Mr. President, .  The  impact  of  climate  change  is  already  with  us  in  Nigeria,  manifesting  in various ways: conflicts trigger; food insecurity, drying up of lakes; loss of livelihood, and youth migration, among others. The trend is the same in many other countries that are threatened by forest fires, rising sea levels, drought and desertification.  H.E. President Muhammadu Buhari                                                                                                                                                                                                       Page  of                                                                                                    . In  the  circumstances,  we  intend  to  build  a  climate-resilient  economy  that effectively aligns with the SDGs and that has great potentials to unlocking the full opportunities in different sectors of the economy, while protecting the resources for present and future generations. I know, in several ways, this is also a familiar story in many countries. .  As  leaders,  we  must  create  inclusive  and  gender-sensitive  policies  that address all issues connected to climate action, from mitigation to resilience. .  Nigeria  believes  that  protecting  our  planet  and  its  biodiversity  and  climate are important to our collective survival. That is why, we are working on a transition to  low  carbon  economy,  consistent  with  achieving  the  Paris  Climate  Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals. Mr. President, .  Combating illicit financial flows and ensuring the recovery and return of illicitly acquired assets have the potential to provide resources in the immediate term for financing development in this era of the COVID- pandemic and beyond. .  Similarly,  corruption  across  national  borders  has  huge  negative  impact  on the stability, peace, and economic prospects of millions, particularly in developing countries. H.E. President Muhammadu Buhari                                                                                                                                                                                                       Page  of                                                                                                       .  It deprives national Governments of resources needed to provide adequate and meaningful sources of livelihood for their citizens. The latter gives rise to more irregular migration patterns, with unwholesome consequences for inter-state and human relations. . I, therefore, call on all leaders to demonstrate the much-needed political will by  supporting  the  recommendations  for  systemic  reforms  made  by  the  FACTI Panel.  .  We support establishing modalities for a global coordination mechanism at the  United  Nations  Economic  and  Social  Council  to  systematically  monitor  illicit financial flows and strengthen financial integrity for sustainable development, with the participation of all relevant stakeholders.  Mr. President, .  On  the  issue  of  debt,  we  have  seen  that  developing  countries  have  been faced with unsustainable debt burdens even before the pandemic. The COVID- pandemic has increased the risk of new wave of deepening debt, where vital public financial resources are allocated to external debt servicing and repayments at the expense of domestic health and financing for critical developmental needs.  . I  must  commend  the  current  initiatives  by  the  international  financial institutions and the G20 aimed at significantly mitigating the economic situation of the indebted countries and urge for more efforts in this regard. H.E. President Muhammadu Buhari                                                                                                                                                                                                       Page  of                                                                                                      .  Therefore, there is an urgent need to consider expansion and extension of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative to include all Developing, Least Developed Countries  and  Small  Island  Developing  States  facing  fiscal  and  liquidity challenges.  In  addition,  a  review  of  the  eligibility  criteria  for  debt  suspension, including  outright  cancellation,  is  needed  for  countries  facing  the  most  severe challenges.  Mr. President, .  Nigeria reaffirms that international trade is an engine for development and sustained economic growth, as well as the global eradication of poverty. .  My delegation would like to reaffirm the critical role that a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system can play in stimulating economic growth and development.  .  Fair  and  equitable  trade  would  eventually  eliminate  the  need  for  aid.  My country and indeed all African countries do not intend to stay  indefinitely looking for aid. All we need is a fair and equitable system of international trade. .  We,  therefore,  call  for  a  reform  agenda  that  will  engender  better  recovery from  this  crisis,  build  resilience  to  future  shocks  and  pursue  transformative development strategies that can deliver the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. Mr. President, .  The  global  food  system  has,  in  recent  times,  been  impacted  by  several factors such as population growth, availability and accessibility of arable land and water resources, climate change, and loss of biodiversity.  Page  of  H.E. President Muhammadu Buhari                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         .  Increased competition for resources such as land, water, and energy, has affected  food  access  and  supply,  particularly  in  developing  countries.  Climate change  and  unpredictable  shocks,  such  as the  current  global  pandemic,  further exacerbate  vulnerabilities  in  the  global  food  system,  requiring  the  UN’s  urgent attention.  .  The Government of Nigeria remains determined to improve the productivity and incomes of small-scale farmers by promoting equal access to land, technology and  markets,  sustainable  food  production  systems  and  resilient  agricultural practices. .  At  the  heart  of  Nigeria’s  post-COVID-  response  is  the  Economic Sustainability Plan, which has a major component, called the Agriculture for Food and Jobs Programme where we seek to leverage suitable technologies to build a resilient food system for the country.  .  An integral part of our food systems’ transformation strategy is to create an enabling and supportive environment to implement these policies in a participatory manner.  .  Global  efforts  to  mitigate  and  sustain  food  systems  must  involve  key stakeholders, including  Governments, farmers, investors,  multilateral organizations, regional bodies, international financial institutions, private partners and civil society organizations. H.E. President Muhammadu Buhari                                                                                                                                                                                                       Page  of                                                                                                      Mr. President, .  Nigeria  has  been  steadfast  in  safeguarding  human  rights,  including  the advancement of women, the protection of children, the protection of the rights of people living with disabilities, the treatment of migrants, refugees, returnees and displaced persons as well as, the promotion of fundamental freedoms through all legitimate means. In this regard, my delegation commends the positive example of leaders like Prime Minister Jacinda Arden of New Zealand. . In this context Nigeria calls for collective global action through a  Treaty to end all forms of violence against women and girls of all ages.  .  Nigeria remains unwavering in its commitment to ensuring the advancement of human rights within its shores and beyond. This is so even in the context of a vicious  decade-long  onslaught  by  terrorists  against  Nigerians,  quite  contrary  to unwholesome reports by some who hardly verify what they state against us.  .  The recent rise in hate related crimes globally underscores the urgent need to continue our engagement about racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and other related intolerance. It is sad to note that the issue of racism remains alive globally.  .  We  are  beginning  to  forget  our  affirmation  of  the  inherent  dignity  and  the equal and inalienable rights of every individual as enshrined in the UN Charter. No society can claim to be free or just if it deprives anyone of these rights.  H.E. President Muhammadu Buhari                                                                                                                                                                                                       Page  of                                                                                                       .  Nigeria  has  long  been  a  principled  fighter  against  racism  and  all  forms  of discrimination  inspired  by  its  African  experience.  In  the  past,  racism  oiled  the machine  of  slavery  and  colonialism.  Today,  racism  drives  hate  crimes  and institutional discrimination. In all this, Africans and people of African descent are among the major victims.  .  Cognizant of these, I commend Member States for adopting by consensus the resolution on the Establishment of the Permanent Forum of People of African Descent on 2nd August 2021. I am confident that this forum will make significant impact in the quest to end race-related vices and injustices. Mr. President, .  No  reform  of  the  United  Nations  system  is  more  urgent  than  that  of  the Security Council. Stakeholders around the world are asking how such power could be  concentrated,  with  scant  representation.  The  intergovernmental  negotiations have taken too long, some  years. We must avoid going in cycles. Consensus has been achieved in some of the elements of this reform, especially that of the representation  of  Africa  on  the  basis  of the  Elzuwini  consensus  and  the  Sirte Declaration.  It  is  unreasonable  to  expect  unanimity  in  this  matter.  The  issue, indeed,  is  about  justice,  not  unanimity.  Without  justice,  the  legitimacy  (even efficacy)  of  our  Organization  is  called  to  question.  We  can  and  must  make substantial, irreversible progress on Security Council reform in the current session.   H.E. President Muhammadu Buhari                                                                                                                                                                                                       Page  of                                                                                                          Mr. President,  .  Connected to this, is the question of justice, fairness, and equity in respect of  the  Palestinian  people.  The  situation  in  the  Middle  East  is  long-standing  and gives cause for concern. Nigeria encourages Israel and Palestine to re-engage in dialogue based on relevant UN resolutions and Initiatives. The two-state solution has the support of the international community and is widely acknowledged as the path to lasting peace.  Mr President, .  Our organization is at the peak of the multilateral system. It is also the pre-eminent body for solving our current and emerging challenges, and for developing norms  that  are  protective  of  us  all.  We  need  to  re-commit  to  it,  rejuvenate  it  to better  serve  us.  Nigeria  re-affirms  its  faith  in  the  United  Nations  and  is  further resolved  to  continue  to  work  with  all  Member-States  for  peace  and  security, development and the protection of human rights. In the current moment, hope for these,  is  dependent  on  how  we  assist  each  other  to  get  COVID-  out  of  all countries, regardless of their classification. We can and must do so.  .     In this regard, let me close my statement by paying special tribute to a great and  humane  internationalist,  and  an  exemplary  practitioner  of  multilateral cooperation. I am speaking of Chancellor Angela Merkel of the Federal Republic of Germany. As she exits the stage, we wish her well.      I thank you. H.E. President Muhammadu Buhari                                                                                                                                                                                                       Page  of                                                                                                    "
26,2021,SLE,Sierra Leone,
27,2021,ATG,Antigua and Barbuda,"President I congratulate you on your election to the presidency of this Seventy-Sixth Session of the General Assembly.  Antigua and Barbuda assures you of our fullest cooperation as you steer ou r collective work in what will be a challenging year. Mr. President I agree wholeheartedly with Secretary-General Antonio Guterres that the international community is failing to deliver policies to support peace, global health, the viability of our planet and other pressing needs.   I also agree with him that the lack of a global response and vaccination programme to end the COVID- pandemic is a clear and tragic example of such failure.    If developed countries had acted in a manner that allowed for the  proper access to vaccines and medical supplies at the onset of the pandemic, globally we would be in a better place. Developing countries were not seeking handouts. Many  of  our  countries paid  into  a  global  system  that  promised  early  access  to vaccines. But  it  could  not  deliver  because,  the  majority  of  the  vaccines  from  the  major pharmaceutical companies had been bought or  contracted  and hoarded by  a  few wealthy nations, leaving the rest of the world bereft of the means to save their people. This selfish nationalism forced most nations to rely on vaccine charity which, in itself, has  not  solved  the  problem  of  large  numbers of  people  remaining unvaccinated throughout the world. No country wanted charity; no country wanted to beg for vaccines that should be a global good accessible to all. We were ready to pay. But the vaccines were hoarded, and the pharmaceutical companies demanded prices beyond the capacity of countries whose economies were already  decimated  by the economic effects of the pandemic. Mr President, the world should not witness such a spectacle again.      What is  significant about the COVID-  pandemic is  that  years  of warnings of an inevitable pandemic threat were not addressed and there was inadequate funding and stress testing of preparedness. The nations that must bear the burden of responsibility for this lack of preparedness must be those who control the world’s health systems and who did nothing to put in place the resources necessary to, at least, alleviate the effects of the pandemic when it came. What was also troubling was the absence of coordinated, global leadership. Instead of cooperation, the world witnessed finger-pointing and conspiracy theories about where the novel coronavirus originated and who was responsible. The  resulting global  tension  undermined multilateral  institutions and  cooperative action. The World Health Organization became  the scapegoat even though it was not the management  of  the  Organization  that  caused  it  to  be  underfunded  and  under resourced. Blame was cast at the WHO as if it is not the representatives of powerful governments who set its priorities and determine how and where its money should be spent and on what. Developing countries, and especially small states, Mr President, have to be absolved from responsibility for the lack of response, because they neither control the decision-making bodies, nor do they have the power to allocate funding. Often the cries of small countries are either ignored or  discarded, even on the few occasions when we actually get a seat at the table. There was no dedicated fund of the size necessary to supply medical equipment and to ensure vaccines would be available to all.  International financing, when it came, was too little and too late. Nothing has changed since then. International financing to stop COVID, and to deal with its impact both on health and economies, is still too little. COVID- is still infecting people all over the world, every minute of every day. People are still dying every minute of every day. Economies are still being ruined every minute of every day. And the prospect of recovery recedes every minute of every day.      Mr.  President, US President Biden is to be congratulated for convening this week a Global Summit on COVID .  He  has shown great  leadership,  and we  are  grateful that  the  United  States  has committed an additional 250M in the first instance to establish a pandemic fund at the World Bank to proactively address future biological threats and pandemics. But more  is  needed, and a more organized global machinery is needed, under the auspices of this UN Organization. In my own participation in President Biden’s Summit on COVID, I made it clear that the  pandemic has wrecked  economies in  small island states  including CARICOM countries. In some  states,  more  than   per  cent of Gross  Domestic  Product has been lost; unemployment has  risen;  poverty  has  expanded and  demands  on  the  State  has multiplied even as revenues have declined steeply. I  told the Biden summit that, for our small countries, recovering from th e economic effects of COVID- will be protracted because hard won economic progress has been greatly reversed.     Therefore, building back will be longer and harder for small island states than it will be in larger economies with greater resources. Thousands of our people have been infected and thousands have died  – many who had not yet begun to enjoy life, and others who had much to contribute. I emphatically stated that the disease must be stopped. Mr President, we must stop behaving as if the Pandemic has ended; it has not. I quote Secretary-General Guterres again, because he is perfectly right when he says:  “The longer the virus circulates among billions of unvaccinated people, the higher the risk that it will develop into more dangerous variants that could rip through vaccinated and unvaccinated populations alike, with a far higher fatality rate”. A high rate of inoculations by rich countries with both the vaccines and the money must  not be regarded  as  a  great  success, not  even for  those countries, because, today, there is no greater truth than the mantra that no country is safe until all countries are safe. Antigua and Barbuda is committed  to  a global drive to  inoculate  per cent of the world’s population by September 2022, My  government  has  taken  the  action  to  make  inoculations  against  COVID- mandatory for all public sector workers to protect the lives of all, including tourists who visit our shores.    We  are  determined  to  overcome  the  baselessly  flawed  arguments  of  those  who promote  resistance to  vaccines despite  the fact  that, sadly,  the number of  COVID victims rise daily. We will educate and inform our people at home. But, Mr. President, we will continue to raise our voice internationally for the equitable distribution of  vaccines at  affordable prices  and for  the reduction in the pricing for COVID testing. Vaccines are a global good; they should not be a commodity for profit at the expense of human life. We are also committed to work for better global planning and preparation for any future pandemic. But while we will play our part utilizing our scarce resources we will continue to argue for the provision of resources to poor and vulnerable countries. We didn’t start the pandemic. And no virus has ever originated in Caribbean countries or being spread from it. We have been – and are – victims of others who must recognize their responsibilities and act on them. In this connection, my  government is extremely  disturbed about incidents in which some countries have not recognised vaccines administered in Caribbean countries, and have forced fully vaccinated travellers in to quarantine. Governments cannot urge people to get inoculated on the basis that the best vaccine is  the  available  vaccine,  and  yet  discriminate  against  vaccines  that  were  not manufactured directly in North America and Europe. This would not only be a form of vaccine apartheid, it would defeat the objective of inoculating  per cent of the world’s people by this time next year. This discrimination must cease now before it becomes a norm by some developed countries.  It is wrong; unjust, and patently unfair. Mr President, my government will cooperate with all governments to protect our world, giving our young people the  chance to  live a safe,  secure, and enjoyable life, but stopping the COVID-  pandemic still  is a  global responsibility and the  burden of sharing its cost must be borne equitably. Antigua and Barbuda warns now that the international system has to prepare for future pandemics which are surely coming, particularly as action on Climate Change has also been a failure. The impact of Climate Change will undoubtedly bring new vector borne diseases and viruses that jump from animal to man.   The World Health Organization, the IMF, the World Bank and this very United Nations Organization must start gearing up now to prepare for the pandemics of the future. The UN Security Council should be treating pandemics as major security risks to the world, and it should act accordingly to use the full powers of the Council to meet these global threats. Never again, Mr  President, should the world be caught unprepared to  manage and end a pandemic swiftly. Never again should millions of people be killed by a  disease that could have been stopped earlier. And never again should there be such a selfish display of nationalism as we witnessed in the response to a Global threat. The same argument applies to Climate Change. Mr.  President,  Antigua and Barbuda hopes that COP26 in Glasgow, at  th e end of October, will be an inflection point at which all nations will commit themselves to saving the planet. There is no planet B.   The consequences of Climate Change will be catastrophic. For some small island states, it already is. Recent research, published by the Royal Institute of International Affairs, reveals a dire situation for the world unless action is taken now by the world’s greatest polluters to significantly reduce their CO2 emissions.  I highlight some of the findings in the report. By  2040,  almost  700 million people each year  will likely be exposed  to  prolonged severe droughts of at least six months’ duration. Many millions will die. Experts  are  concerned that  climate  change is likely to  increase the prevalence of emerging infectious diseases and vector-borne diseases.  They  argue  that  Climate  Change disrupts  ecosystems  and  increases  the  risk  of diseases jumping to new hosts.   Scientists  have  been  warning  for  many  years  of  the  probability  of  pandemics increasing as a result of climate change.   In 2008, a study published in the journal Nature, found that over the previous decade nearly one-third of emerging infectious diseases were vector-borne, with the jumps to humans corresponding to changes in the climate.  For  instance,  insects  such  as geographic temperature patterns.  infection-bearing  mosquitoes  follow  changing According  to  the  research,  interconnections  between  shifting  weather  patterns, resulting in changes to ecosystems, and the rise of pests and diseases, combined with   heatwaves and droughts, will likely drive unprecedented crop failure, food insecurity and migration of people.  All this, the report argues, could result in the potential breakdown of governance and political systems as societies become increasingly unstable due to lack of income, as well as competition, over limited food supplies.  The report says that Experts are concerned that such situations could lead to a rise of extremist groups, paramilitary intervention, organized violence, and conflict between people and states. That should be a scenario that worries us all, for, as we have seen in recent times, no nation is immune from violent strife. Mr  President, it is evident that global solidarity and firm commitments  are required; commitments that will result in emission cuts to reduce global temperatures below . degrees Celsius of preindustrial levels. Equally vital is access to quality financing and climate technologies in order to save our planet. And, contracting debt to pay for recovery from th e effects of Climate Change and to build resilience is  not the answer to  the problems  of small states  that  are  already burdened by debt and are the worst affected. Funding packages  for Small Island Developing States  should include a  significant amount of official development assistance – in other words, grants not loans.  Most states have significant debt overhang. They are simply not in a position to assume more debt, especially after the economic devastation of the COVID- pandemic.  And, Mr President, the ODA component in funding for SIDS should not be seen as a gift or charity. Let me here thank the Government of Denmark that has announced its proposal  to significantly increase its contribution to climate aid.  The Danish government wrote to me, a few days ago, to say that it has earmarked  percent of its annual grant for adaptation and resilience initiatives, especially in the most vulnerable countries. Note that Denmark is giving a grant, not a loan. Mr President, the news that Denmark will contribute more than  percent of the global collective target for climate financing is welcome with deep appreciation.    It is my hope that Denmark’s action will help to galvanize others to contribute their fair share to the collective efforts required to address climate change at C0P26. Mr  President, industrialized countries have an obligation to  assist  the  states  most affected by Climate Change because they created a problem in the first instance.    Climate ODA should be seen as a form of climate reparations to compensate for past climate damage.  In  addition to  official development assistance, debt  swaps,  and debt  cancellation; climate related debts would help small states  to build financial capacity to accelerate the transition into renewable technologies. No  new  or  significant sums  of  monies  would be  needed  to  achieve  these  debt cancellations; they would be mere  book entries that will bring significant relief and sustainability to  SIDS,  while at the same  time  not creating any significant financial pressures for the industrialized countries.  This is a non-confrontational form of climate justice. The  alternative  is,  that  affected  states  may  be  forced  to  take  legal  action in  the international courts to seek compensation for provable damage. Such a course is not one that small states would take with alacrity, but some of us may have to do so from necessity. If nothing is done by the major polluting country both to cease their destructive actions and to help to repair the damage that they are causing, we may be left no choice. That is not our preference. We want global solidarity in the face of global adversity. Mr President, there is an obvious need for a realignment of the international financial architecture to accelerate the global transition into renewables, in order to achieve a carbon neutral world within the next two decades. Let me point out one serious anomaly. While  developed  countries  in  North  America  and  Europe  are  urging  small  and vulnerable states to transition to alternative energy, they are providing US$. trillion annually to subsidize fossil fuel businesses. By contrast,  the sum being made available to developing countries is a mere US$ billion a year. If developed countries simply shifted their spending from providing subsidies to fossil fuel businesses to helping developing countries to cope with the impact of Climate Change, not only would they not have to spend one additional cent, they would also create greater opportunities for renewable energy in their own countries. The world would also be less polluted, and Climate Change would retreat. Mr President, I want to remind everyone that investments in nuclear armaments and other weapons cannot sustain the planet, but investment to combat climate change will certainly save our Earth, our single homeland and our human civilisation. That  is  why  we  should all  work  diligently  at  COP26  in  Glasgow  to  strengthen everyone’s commitment to . degrees Celsius for us all to stay alive.    Mr  President,  I  have  concentrated  my  statement  at  this  year’s  assembly  on  the COVID-  pandemic and Climate  Change because they  are  the  two  overarching issues that confront mankind. Dealing with them successfully is what will give future generations a chance to live in peace, prosperity and safety. Those generations are our children and grandchildren. So what future do we want for them? Should we not act to  give them the glorious future we want for them, and that they deserve? We certainly should. I Thank you      "
28,2021,BRB,Barbados,
29,2021,DMA,Dominica,"President of the 76th Session Excellencies Distinguished Delegates Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. President, on behalf of the Government and People of the Commonwealth of Dominica, I congratulate you on your election to the Presidency of the  th Session of the United Nations General Assembly and wish you every success.  Mr. President, we are convening this 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, at a time when our Planet Earth is at its warmest and  each and every member state is grappling with the impact of the deadly COVID- pandemic. Dominica’s Experience: Excellencies, the Commonwealth of Dominica recorded its first COVID- case on March  , 2020, and  for more than  months, even with limited resources, we managed  to keep  our number  of  active cases  within double digits and  without recording  a  single  COVID-  related  death….because  from  the  onset,  our Government  adopted  comprehensive  COVID-  containment  measures  and protocols.  We have however in recent weeks seen a spike in cases, and have recorded our first COVID-  deaths and we have had to redirect scarce  resources to combat this surge, while increasing investment in primary health care services.                Excellencies, distinguished delegates, we consider ourselves fortunate and express gratitude for being a recipient of donations of vaccines from the Governments of Republic of India, the Peoples’ Republic of China, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and through the COVAX facility. We are fully aware, however, that there are still several countries with limited or no access to COVID- vaccines and we call on member states and the International Community by extension, to acknowledge the importance of  -Resolution /274; adopted by the United Nations General Assembly, which calls for the strengthening of supply chains that promote and ensure universal, fair, inclusive, transparent, equitable, efficient and timely access to medicines, vaccines and other health supplies in order to address the COVID- pandemic. Dominica firmly supports the view that vaccines are a public good and that no one is safe until everyone is safe. Excellencies, Science has proven that vaccines are an important way out of this pandemic,  and  a  coordinated response to COVID-  is not possible without an open and supportive multilateral system.  I  wish  to  thank  the  World  Health  Organisation,  the  Pan-American  Health Organisation,  the  Caribbean  Public  Health  Agency  and  all  our  other  bilateral partners for  their continued support  in our  effort  at  preventing, detecting, and responding to this pandemic and we are particularly appreciative of the leadership of PAHO and its provision of vaccines, technical support, medical equipment and supplies under the COVAX Mechanism.          Mr. President, Dominica would like to place on record our deepest gratitude to the Government of India for allowing us to be among the first of developing countries to begin the vaccination of our citizens.  We also express our gratitude to the Government of Republic of Cuba for allowing its medical brigade to compliment the services of our heath care workers who have been stretched to capacity and  to the Government of  the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela for supplying PPEs and test kits as part of our response. The Government of the Peoples’ Republic of China continues to be a true friend to Dominica, by being one of the first countries to our aid, with the supply of masks, other  Personal  Protective  Equipment,  ventilators, testing  and  other  diagnostic supplies and ventilators, especially during the early days of the pandemic, when these were in short supply. Mr. President, to survive this pandemic and to better prepare for the future, priority must therefore be given to universal access to quality healthcare services to all citizens. This will require a greater role for the World Health Organization and its hemispheric counterparts such as the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO), Caribbean Public Health Agency (CAPHA).  For small developing states like Dominica, the COVID- pandemic threatens to reverse the gains that we have made in the socio-economic development of our people, by placing additional burdens on national budgets as our governments are forced to provide increased support to our citizens.  Excellencies, the closure of businesses, and the additional cost of operating businesses during the restrictions occasioned by the actions to contain the virus, is having an extremely debilitating impact on the private sector.         Our tourism industries have been dealt a devastating blow, as the impact has been most severe in the hotel, hospitality, and service sectors. We must therefore work collectively to end this deadly pandemic.  Mr. President, Distinguished Delegates; living with the COVID-  pandemic  and preparing  for  future  pandemics  must  now  become  essential  components  of sustainable development. Developing  countries like  Dominica  are  at  risk  of  not  being  able  to  meet  our Sustainable Development Goals if this pandemic continues to severely impact our people and countries. Thus, our international development partners, both bilateral and multilateral, must be responsive to our new realities and calls for more creative financial instruments that take into account these new realties.  Dominica is of the view that, this new dispensation must also reward countries for progressive policies directed at creating sustainable systems for production and consumption.  Universal access to quality healthcare must now be pursued more aggressively, whilst at the same time, access to quality and relevant education must continue, if small  states  are  to  build  capacity  and  advance  their  national  sustainable development agendas.    Climate Change Mr. President, rising sea levels coupled with more frequent and extreme weather events, make the Caribbean one of the most vulnerable regions in the world.             Recent weather phenomena in the Commonwealth of Dominica suggest that the climate is indeed changing, with increases in temperature, changes in the seasons and erratic temperature variations.  Fellow Delegates, according  to the  World Bank  study entitled: “Turn  Down the Heat”, the number of severe hurricanes is projected to increase by  percent, with double the intensity, as warming rises by C and up to  percent in case of a C warming.  A  single disaster event  can  affect  an  entire territory  or  economy  and  cause  a disproportionately high loss of GDP as was the case with Hurricane Maria, which affected all the economic and social sectors in Dominica with an estimated impact of 226% of GDP.    Distinguished Delegates,  Dominica  continues to  call on  the major  polluters to take more aggressive actions to reduce global warming, as our planet will not be able to sustain life as we know it, if  they continue to pursue their unsustainable systems of production and consumption unabated.  Dominica is working on becoming the world’s first climate resilient nation and we are committed to doing more than just adapt to the impact of climate change  but these major polluters MUST take up their responsibilities to support Small island developing nations like ours, to achieve these goals.  We would like to thank our International partners who have helped to create the Climate Resilient Execution Agency of Dominica (CREAD),  to coordinate donor-funded climate resilient projects, as we mainstream resilience across sectors.  Mr.  President, recently, the  Government  of  Dominica  approved the Comprehensive National Resilience Development Strategy and the development         of  Dominica’s  Climate  Resilience  and  Recovery  Plan  (CRRP),  which  further underscores Government’s commitment towards disaster risk reduction, resilience building  at  all  levels  and  the  development  of  sound  response  and  recovery mechanisms. Dominica looks forward to the renewal of discussions at COP  in a few weeks times, where commitments made under the  Paris agreement can be re visited and honoured, especially as it pertains to climate financing. This is a matter of climate justice!  As Dominica and other SIDS are not responsible for the warming of our planet but we are disproportionately impacted by the effect of climate change.    Renewable Energy Mr. President, one of the major contributors to climate change is the consumption of  fossil  fuel  for  the  production  of  electricity  and  for  transportation  and  the importation  of  fossil  fuel,  has  over  the  years,  had  the  greatest  impact  on  the economic vulnerability of many Small Island Developing States.   The transition of  the energy sector away from  fossil fuel, therefore, is central to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, building resilience to economic and climate related events and ultimately, pursuing a sustainable development pathway.  Mr.  President,  the  Commonwealth  of  Dominica  continues  to  pursue  the development of its geothermal resources as this will allow us to move away from the importation of  fossil fuel for the generation of electricity within the next five years, while also reducing the cost of electricity to our people.            The  development of  geothermal energy also has  the potential to sustain  clean-mobility and to create a new industrial revolution powered by a cleaner and more affordable energy.  To  date,  our  efforts  to  develop  our  country’s  geothermal  potential  have  been supported  by  several  partners:  the  UK,  World  Bank,  SIDS  DOCK,  Caribbean Development  Bank, Inter-American  Development  Bank, the  European Commission, the Government of New Zealand, the Clinton Climate Initiative and the United Arab Emirates., and we would like to thank them all.  Mr.  President,  the  plight  of  our  brothers and  sisters in  the  Republic  of  Haiti continues,  much  to  the  concern  of  Dominica  and  the  rest  of  the  Caribbean Community.  Over the last decade,  Haiti has struggled with rising poverty levels, sustained political instability and numerous disasters, resulting in extreme hardship the citizens of this sister Caribbean nation.  Haiti is currently in the top  countries experiencing a food crisis. The United nations must therefore take leadership in coordinating targeted support to the Haitian Government for the benefit of its people.   Excellencies, our Caribbean region also continues to call for the discontinuation of the economic, financial and  trade embargo on our brothers and sisters in the Republic of Cuba.   Notwithstanding this  decades-old  embargo,  the  Republic  of  Cuba  continues to make a positive impact on our region, and the wider world and we renew our call to the  Government of the United States to allow the people of Cuba  to be fully integrated into the global trading system, to improve their lives and to allow the world  to  continue  to  benefit  from  their  tremendous  contributions especially  in science and technology.         Mr. President,  Dominica is convinced that  as a collective we have the ability to solve all of the challenges which confront us.  The extreme pace of human advancement in the 21st century has demonstrated that we have the capacity and ingenuity to combat climate change, and to develop means of production and consumption to sustain humanity, while at the same time protecting our planet. We must all recommit to playing our part to save our planet and to improve the lives  of  citizens worldwide: Those  who  suffer  from  hunger  and  starvation,  and others  who  continue  to  be  marginalized  will  be  pointless  without  peace  and security.  The destruction brought about by wars within and between countries continues to displace  millions  of  people  from  their  homes  creating  unprecedented  refugee crises.  Mr.  President,  Excellences,  Distinguished delegates,  the United Nations  is a critical  player  in  maintaining  world  peace  and  security and  Dominica  remains committed to collaborating with the United Nations and all its agencies, as well as Member States, to strengthen the Mission of this noble institution.    We  commend  the  leadership  of  the  Secretary  General  in  this  regard  and  we  reaffirm  our  confidence  in  the  UN  system  as  the  ultimate  negotiating  and deliberating body for addressing major challenges confronting the world.   Mr. President, history will record both our actions and inactions that can result in educating and saving our generation from this pandemic, and from global         warming and climate change, thus ensuring a safer planet for our children, and future generations.     I Thank You.    "
30,2021,DOM,Dominican Republic,"President of the Seventy-sixth session of the General Assembly, Secretary General of the United Nations, Distinguished Heads of State and Government, Distinguished delegates, As we approach the second anniversary of the start of the worst catastrophe in nearly a century, humankind has not yet been able to definitively close this terrible episode of the COVID- pandemic. Nevertheless, we come to this forum with the hope of renewing and strengthening the bonds of cooperation and solidarity as fraternal nations.  This global community of states faces  enormous challenges that can only be effectively addressed through a renewed multilateralism.  Indeed, in the face of the pandemic, the climate emergency, the technological revolution and the need to articulate a new paradigm for the welfare state, it is necessary to strengthen unity and cooperation among all nations.  We have a historical responsibility to leave a better world than the one we find, but this is only  possible  if  we  take  seriously  the  global  transition  towards  a  new  ecological,  sustainable, inclusive and equitable production model, in line with the sustainable development goals of the 2030 Agenda.  This change is only possible from a global and multilateral effort that guarantees the rule of law, human rights and the well-being of all people, leaving no one behind. Despite this unfortunate scenario created by the pandemic, our government has promoted a free vaccination plan that has been successful, with visible results and impressive figures: % of the eligible population is fully vaccinated, approximately % has at least one dose and more than % of the population received a third dose, with a lethality rate of .%, one of the lowest in the world. In  line  with  our  vision  of  co-responsibility  to  get  out  of  this  pandemic,  and  having  an inventory of vaccines that has allowed it, we have donated in solidarity some 820 thousand doses to countries in our region that need them, convinced that we will only be safe, when we are all vaccinated.         However, although we have begun to overcome the pandemic, this will not be enough to overcome the economic and financial crisis. In the interest of maintaining social peace, we are urged to find a solution to the enormous indebtedness that middle-income countries have been forced into to deal with the economic and social ravages generated by the pandemic. There  is  currently  no  mechanism  for  access  to  concessional  financing  that  allows  these countries to solve this liquidity crisis.  To overcome this challenge, we are forced to look for new and urgent solutions. Recently,  the  Board  of  Governors  of  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  had  an allocation of Special Drawing Rights (SDR) for an amount equivalent to US $ 650,000 million with  the  objective  of  strengthening  global  liquidity.    IMF  member  states  received  these  funds according to the corresponding quotas per country. This means that a large proportion of these resources was taken by the developed countries, precisely those that need them the least. To remedy this unfair situation, industrialized countries should use these resources to create a mechanism to channel the quotas they have received to middle- and low-income countries, giving them  access  to  concessionary  funds.  In  such  a  mechanism,  multilateral  financial  organizations would play a key role, thus ensuring that these resources reach the countries that really need them. This initiative would have a very positive impact on international financial markets, as it would make debt more sustainable and strengthen confidence in our economies, thus improving the cost of financing.  Mr. president, The  government  that  I  am  honored  to  chair  has  the  firm  belief  that  democracy  is  the political system that best guarantees the dignity, well-being and happiness of the people, and that it can only be sustained if it is deepened and expanded.   For this reason, I am proud that we had convened all sectors of national life to initiate an open  and  plural  dialogue  to  achieve  reforms  that  contribute  to  strengthening  the  social  and democratic rule of law in the Dominican Republic.   Therefore, for this reason the Dominican Republic is a strong advocate of democracy and human rights, which implies strengthening checks and balances to the executive branch, such as an independent judiciary, whose decisions will be widely respected by everyone.  This government is  committed  to  ensuring  the  independence  of  the  Public  Prosecutor's  Office  and  other  control                  agencies,  as  well  as  the  reform  of  the  National  Police  to  guarantee  the  rule  of  law  and  citizen security. In the same sense, our fundamental purpose is to defend the public interest, the common patrimony  of  Dominicans,  which  implies  an  absolutely  transparent  management,  one  of  the achievements  that gives us the greatest satisfaction. We are convinced that,  in  the midst of the current  circumstances  laden  with  obstacles,  the  public  continues  to  demand  that  we  act  with courage against corruption and we have been showing this with clear, precise and forceful actions. In another vein, and with regard to the economy, I am pleased to point out that even in the midst of these difficulties, our country is optimistic and we are sure that this year we will achieve economic and social balance.  We plan to end 2021 with an economic growth of % and maintain a growth rate of % for the following years. Mr. president, I would like to suggest three actions that we consider urgent and necessary for our region and our country .  The Dominican Republic, as a Small Island Developing State, is one of the countries that emits the least greenhouse gases but is most affected by climate change. Now is the time to promote a global transformation of the economy in line with the levels of development so that the required standards do not impose excessive burdens that result in additional costs detrimental to competitiveness and the production of our goods and services. It is also fair and necessary that the investment to restore our natural resources affected by global warming created by the countries that have generated the most CO2, be the ones to pay for the huge investments to be made. .  The  current  financial  crisis  and  higher  indebtedness  caused  by  the  pandemic  cannot only  be  left  to  be  solved  by  increasing  taxes  in  our  respective  countries  with  its consequent social pressures and possible disruption of peace. We must be creative; we are convinced that, at no cost to their governments, multilateral and bilateral financial institutions can grant credit facilities through transparent and accessible, concerted and non-discriminatory  mechanisms  that  help  countries  in  difficulty  to  quickly  regain financial sustainability and access to international financial markets, with preferential rates that are not affected by the country risk index. Mr. president,               .  Our  third  and  final  recommendation  for  action  is  on  Haiti.  Since  this  government assumed  power,  we  have  been  making  the  possibility  that  the  announced  Haitian situation  could  go  beyond  the  borders  of  that  country,  influencing  as  a  factor  of insecurity in the region.  Hence the need for this community of nations to assume with urgency  and  once  and  for  all,  the  Haitian  crisis  as  one  of  the  highest  priority  and permanent monitoring. We  have  noted  that  recently  some  governments  have  taken  steps  to  address  the consequences of the Haitian crisis.  For years, every day, our country has faced, practically alone, these consequences. We are convinced that no unilateral action will be sufficient to overcome this dramatic situation. It is imperative to state in the strongest and most blunt way possible that the international community  should  not  and  cannot  abandon  the  Haitian  people  at  a  time  when  the  levels  of insecurity are driving them to self-destruction. And I want to say it today in the sincerest way and outside of diplomatic language. With  the  current  division  among  the  Haitian  leadership,  and  the  dangerous  presence  of criminal gangs that control a large part of their territory, Haitians alone will not be able to pacify their country, much less guarantee the conditions to establish a minimum of order. Therefore, the most important and immediate issue is security in Haiti. Only after this has been achieved could free, fair and reliable elections be held. Then, with a new government as a legitimate interlocutor, it will be possible to draft a truly comprehensive economic and social development plan, with all the necessary resources and supported in solidarity by  the  international  community,  since  it  is  no  longer  possible  to  think  only  of  humanitarian measures. To  this  solemn  conclave,  I  declare  that  the  Dominican  Republic  has  shown  and  will continue to show its due solidarity and collaboration with the Haitian people, but I also reiterate that THERE IS NOT, NOR WILL THERE EVER BE, A DOMINICAN SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS IN HAITI. Mr. president, The number of challenges that our states face is significant for the construction of a world under  the  banner  of  equality.    However,  we  must  not  face  them  alone;  integration  and multilateralism are the ideal ways to advance towards the goal without leaving anyone behind.                It  is  my  firm  conviction  that  the  leadership  of  the  United  Nations  will  continue  to  be renewed  and  strengthened  every  day.    The  Dominican  State  reaffirms  its  commitment  to  the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations: peace, human dignity, justice, social progress and freedom. Firm progress towards a renewed and more equitable welfare state. Let us not fail our peoples.  Let's not fail history. Thank you.           "
31,2021,GRD,Grenada,"President,  Mr. Secretary-General, Excellencies,  Distinguished Delegates, It is an honour to address you and this noble body in my capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs, International Business and CARICOM Affairs of Grenada. I extend congratulations to you, on your election as President of the 76th Session of the UN General Assembly.  We reiterate our confidence in you and your team to lead this Session, and we offer our support for the work ahead this year, under the theme, ""Building resilience through hope - to recover from COVID-, rebuild sustainably, respond to the needs of the planet, respect the rights of people, and revitalise the United Nations"". I join my esteemed colleagues in commending and thanking the outgoing President of the 75th General Assembly, His Excellency Volkan Bozkir, for his able stewardship of the General Assembly during the past year.   I take this opportunity to congratulate Secretary-General Antnio Guterres on his re-appointment to serve and lead this august institution for another  years. I applaud his       tireless efforts and commitment in addressing the growing global challenges, including the COVID- pandemic and climate change crisis, as we collectively pursue sustainable solutions. Mr. President,  As  we  continue  to  grapple  with  COVID-,  its  death  toll,  the  negative  impact  on  our economies, the social fallouts, and the inequitable access to vaccines, particularly for small island developing states like Grenada, all of which undermine the stability and survival of our peoples, the theme for this year’s General Assembly could not have been more appropriate.  Mr. President,  COVID- has indeed wreaked immense havoc on economies across the world, but with a particular intensity and lasting effect on small economies such as ours. Prior to the first case of  COVID-  on  the  island  in  March  2020,  the  Grenadian  economy  was  on  an  upward trajectory since 2013, growing at an average rate of . per cent per year.  This growth was mainly driven by robust activities in the construction, tourism and private education  sectors.  This  upward  trend  in  output  was  disrupted  by  the  pandemic  with preliminary estimates showing that the economy contracted by . percent in 2020. Stark declines were recorded in several sectors, most notably Tourism and Air Transport.        Unemployment rose from a record low of . percent in the fourth quarter of 2019 to . percent in the second quarter of 2020, with ,000 jobs being lost as a direct consequence of the pandemic. The  socio-economic  fallout  from  the  pandemic  has  been  especially  severe  for  vulnerable groups, particularly women, youth and the unskilled, who are overrepresented in the tourism and informal sectors, which were hardest hit by the pandemic.  Sixteen  months  after  the  first  COVID-  case  was  reported  on-island,  the  local  economy continues to experience the lingering effects.  For the first six months of the year, economic activity was below pre-COVID levels, but slightly above the comparable period in 2020.  Data for the first quarter of 2021 show periods of declines in most sectors, including hotels and air transport. However, there are indications of improved economic activity relative to 2020 as evidenced by second quarter data available for most sectors.  Visitor arrivals also increased during the second quarter of 2021 relative to the same period in 2020. This trend is expected to continue in the second half as vaccination rollouts increase and cross-border travel improves globally.         Enhanced implementation of the Public Sector Investment Programme (PSIP) should further stimulate the economy and increase investor confidence.  The unemployment rate has dropped since the spike in the second quarter of 2020 to . percent in the fourth quarter, but increased slightly in the first quarter of 2021 to . percent, which is the most recent data available.  The rate of recovery globally and locally is slower than initially projected. Inequity in vaccine access,  slower  than  anticipated  vaccination  rates,  vaccine  hesitancy,  emergence  of  new COVID-  variants,  second  and  third  waves  of  the  pandemic  in  several  countries,  trade disruptions, as well as rising commodity prices and freight costs, are factors which hinder global economic recovery, and thus, the recovery of the local economy. Nonetheless, the Government of Grenada continues to implement policies and measures to protect lives and safeguard livelihoods during this period of extreme uncertainty.  The priorities for the 2022 Budget are based  on Government’s strategic policy agenda for recovery,  transformation  and  resilience,  which  is  set  out  in  its  Medium-term  Action  Plan (MTAP) for the period 2022 to 2024.        The  various  actions  of  the  multi-year  MTAP  are  the  vehicles  through  which  the  National Sustainable Development Plan (NSDP) 2020-2035 is being implemented. The MTAP for the period  2022-2024  sets  out  the  strategic  actions  for  implementation,  for  the  responsible entities,  the  performance  indicators  and  the  alignment  with  relevant  SDGs,  under  each National Goal and Outcome of the NSDP.   Mr. President, it is imperative that we continue to stress and address the reclassification of our status by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Development Assistant Committee (DAC), which has resulted in marginalisation of the quantum of development assistance to the region.   This is clearly problematic.  We again urge advocacy and support from Organisations, including those under the umbrella of the United Nations, in the dismantling of these unfair rulings. We reiterate that economic data such as Gross Domestic Product per capita does not reflect the true nature of the vulnerability of Caribbean States.  We, therefore, repeat our call for the creation of a Multidimensional Vulnerability Index that adequately addresses those vulnerabilities. We strongly urge that they be completed no later than the end of 2022.        Small and vulnerable to natural disasters and the effects of Climate Change, we  continue to call for advocacy where the International Financial Institutions (IFIs) are concerned, to allow us to effectively face the developmental challenges posed by the pandemic, and regain access to concessional financing. We take the opportunity to thank all States, including Cuba, Mexico, Argentina, The People’s Republic of China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and others, which provided and continue to provide direct medical assistance to Grenada, to deal with the pandemic. Mr. President, CARICOM Member States, including Grenada, have reaffirmed our commitment to tackling the phenomenon that is Climate Change.  We call for continued support and assistance, not only with mitigation, but also with building human resource capacity, which should be complemented by sustainable growth and transformation.  Increased resource capacity and resilient infrastructure will clearly assist with risk reduction and resilience. Like many Small Island Developing States (SIDS), Grenada faces extreme risks in the agriculture sector, which not only affect our food security, but also have negative impacts on our main export Crops, fruits crops, Forestry, Livestock and Fisheries.        In order to respond to these impacts and increasing threats, Grenada is moving quickly to implement Climate Smart Agriculture as one of the Climate Change Adaptation strategies to reduce impacts.  We, therefore, have an urgent need to access additional resources to guarantee the survival of our agriculture sector through climate smart practices. Mr. President, we not only have to grapple with Climate Change, but with ensuring the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans, seas and marine resources.  This continues to be one of Grenada’s top policy agenda items.  Our Government has adopted an ambitious “Blue Growth” agenda to sustainably utilise our vast maritime territory, which is over seventy () times the size of our land space, and its countless resources, which represent a significant contributor to the GDP of the country. Grenada looks forward with great hope to the UN Ocean Conference in 2022, and driving well overdue  global  ocean  action,  through  science-based  innovative  solutions,  for  sustainable development, as we embark on the Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development 2021 - 2030.   Mr. President, we cannot discuss climate change in isolation to health. In the wake of the COVID- pandemic, Grenada calls for advocacy for an enabling environment to promote       and adopt the One Health Agenda at a global level, an approach that recognises the connection between well-being, prosperity, and a healthy environment. As we seek to prevent, detect, and respond to future pandemics, non-communicable diseases, including mental health, must also be examined.  Our planetary health and climate change require an integrated policy, and, among other things, cooperation, leadership, governance, and political will, as well as the sharing of resources and expertise to find better and more urgent solutions. Mr. President, let me categorically state that Grenada, as part of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), strongly condemns racism, intolerance and discrimination in any form, as well as acts and crimes associated with racism and discrimination. Mr. President,  Grenada welcomes the General Assembly’s unanimous adoption, on 2nd August 2021, of the resolution entitled “Establishment of the Permanent Forum of People of African Descent”, a momentous undertaking on the anniversary of the abolition of slavery across CARICOM, almost 200 years ago.  Even as contemporary issues demand our focus and attention, Grenada and the Caribbean Community remain conscious of the history and the impact of slavery.      From our standpoint, we understand all too well the challenges faced in turning global political commitment into meaningful reality. We, therefore, call for greater international attention to this issue. The international community cannot address sustainable development without considering its interconnectivity to human rights. Mr. President, It is with immense pride that I also highlight the historic and successful inaugural Africa-CARICOM Summit, graciously hosted by His Excellency Uhuru Kenyatta, President of the Republic of Kenya, on  September 2021.  Moreover, with the establishment of a CARICOM Mission in Kenya, it is our sincere hope that the Caribbean and African Regions will continue to build on, and deepen, our bonds of friendship and cooperation. Mr. President,          Every year, Grenada reiterates the counter-productivity of the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba, and the inhumane socio-economic hardships it places on the people of the Republic of Cuba, a Country that has provided a wealth of humanitarian assistance around the world, including during the onslaught of COVID-, but is nonetheless, hindered from participating in the global economy.  We again thank our sister island nation of Cuba for its solidarity, and its invaluable contribution and support to Grenada, our region, and the world, in the fight against the COVID- pandemic, and many other areas of support.  Mr. President, Grenada votes annually with the overwhelming majority of the General Assembly in support of General Assembly resolutions calling for the removal of the Embargo against the Government and people of Cuba.  This year, we again issue another clarion call for the complete removal of this Embargo and respect for the rights of the Cuban people. We further call for the readmission of Cuba, unhindered, to the economic, commercial, and financial community of nations. Mr. President,  Grenada also calls for a stronger global response for Haiti’s recovery, and also for an increased response to other humanitarian and security crises unfolding globally.      Mr. President, As I conclude, Grenada reiterates its steadfast support for the pursuit of international peace and security, and believes that law and security are the sine qua non for the facilitation of the peaceful settlement of disputes, a vital component to achieving and maintaining international peace and security. Grenada reiterates its call that the United Nations membership reflect on its governing principles, as set out in its Charter.  It is against this backdrop, Mr. President, that we, the community of nations—working in tandem in our relentess pursuit of the achievement of the goals of this distinguished Organisation—can relish in HOPE: HOPE for a more just and inclusive society; HOPE for rebuilding sustainable societies that adequately respond to the needs of our shared home, Earth; HOPE to reinvorgate and revitalise OUR United Nations; and, HOPE that, by standing together, with mutual respect, we prove to be resilient to—and overcome—the challenges of today.  Mr. President, now is the time to turn hope into meaningful action, for the benefit of all our Peoples. I thank you.      "
32,2021,JAM,Jamaica,"President, The  theme  for  this  year’s  debate  with  its  emphasis  on  building  resilience,  is welcomed  as  the  world  searches  for  ways  to  manage  the  COVID- pandemic, with its dreadful impacts on all aspects of human existence.   We  must  inspire  hope  to  drive  our  emergence  from  the  scourge  of  this pandemic better and stronger than we were before.   Vaccines and the Global Response Mr President, At the core of building resilience is restoring the health and well-being of our people.    The  pandemic  has  exacerbated  challenges  in  this  area,  especially for  Small Island  Developing  States,  like  Jamaica,  which  already  face  limited resources in the health sector.          Most  regrettably,  many  lives  have  been  lost  and  we  extend  condolences.  There  are  increasing  uncertainties  as  the  pandemic  continues  and  new variants  emerge.  While  mitigation  efforts  to  help  to  reduce  transmission  and mortality  remain  crucial,  the  long-term  solution  must  be  vaccines  that  are accessible  to  all.      We  know  that  vaccines  only  work  if  a  critical  threshold  is attained. Sharing vaccines in a strategic manner, serves the global common good,  as  no  country  will  be  safe  until  all  are  safe.   Jamaica  supports  a globally  coordinated  approach  to  the  scaling  up  of  production  and equitable distribution of vaccines, with the United Nations at the core. We  welcome  the  support  received  from  bilateral  and  international  partners and through the COVAX Facility.   COVAX  was  conceived  as  an  expression  of  multilateralism,  bringing widespread  aspirations  of  hope  in  the  collective  approach.    To  date, however,  it  has  not  met  expectations,  as  its  noble  ideals  have  been displaced by nationalistic endeavours, ironically, at a time when a pandemic requires  global  coordinated  action.    Notwithstanding,  we  believe  in  the essential  merits  of  the  Facility  and  call  for  urgent,  increased  international collaboration  to  avoid  the  widening  gap  in  recovery  across  countries  and regions. Closing the Digital Divide  Mr President, Today,  we  see  some  countries  receiving  a  ‘digital  dividend’  while  others suffer  the  consequences  of  a  ‘digital  divide.’  There  is  need  to  address urgently  the  latter  in  support  of  COVID-  adaptation  measures,  response and recovery  efforts.   Accelerated  digitalization, remote  work  and education,  e-commerce  and  the  virtual  delivery  of  essential  services,  have        allowed  the  digitally  connected  to  thrive  while  severely  exacerbating  the inequalities faced by the digitally disconnected.  This is particularly evident in our  rural  areas,  along  gender  lines  and  generally  among  the  poorest  and most vulnerable.   Addressing  the  negative  consequences  will  require  greater  engagement  of the  public  and  private  sectors  in  building  foundations  for  long  term development.    Leaving  no  one  behind  today  means leaving  no  one  offline.  That  is  why  Jamaica  has  been  working  to  ensure  that  the  tools  needed  to adapt and thrive, are provided to our citizens. Mr President The  COVID-  pandemic  has  also  spurred  innovation  and  new  forms  of collaboration  across  sectors.    We  are  committed  to  the  development  of  a sustainable  framework  to  ensure  the  availability  of  human  capital  to  meet the  growing  and  changing  needs  of  the  economy.    Jamaica  is  taking  an inclusive  approach  to  improve  digital  literacy,  through  increased  access  to, and  use  of  ICT,  by  %  in  public  institutions,  schools  and  key  public  areas  in the country, over the next four years.  We are engaging our private sector to improve the  application  of  science, technology  and innovation in educational institutions, towards national development.  We believe that countries should be supported in  their efforts to build robust and resilient digital infrastructure.  Public investments of this sort can serve as a force  multiplier in  narrowing the  gaps that result in inequitable developmental  outcomes.  Universal, secure  and  affordable  digital connectivity  is  needed  to  ensure  inclusive  and  sustainable  development.  We,  therefore  advocate  for  an  increased  digital  alliance  within  the  global community and support the  UN Secretary General’s High-Level Panel on the Digital Cooperation Roadmap.        Banking on the SDGs and the FfD Initiative  Mr. President,  The  multiple  challenges  associated  with  the  COVID-  pandemic,  have placed  severe  pressure  on  our  fiscal  accounts,  threatening  our  hard-won macro-economic stability.  The pandemic has demonstrated how quickly our development gains can be eroded and that much more needs to be done by  the  international  community  to  secure  a  resilient  future  for  the  most vulnerable.    We  must  retain  hope  in  our  ability  to  meet  the  targets  for  the SDGs, even with adjusted timelines. Mr. President,  Last  year,  along  with  the  Prime  Minister  of  Canada  and  the  UN  Secretary-General,  Heads  of  State  and  Government  and  key  international  partners,  I convened  the  Financing  for  Development  in  the  Era  of  COVID-  and Beyond,  Initiative.  The  outcome  was  ambitious,  yet  practical,  with  policy options to support COVID- response and recovery for consideration by the international community. It now remains for us to take action.   Mr. President, For  Jamaica,  we  anticipate  real  GDP  recovery  within    years,  given  the relative  strength  of  our  economy  and  the  stimulus  packages  implemented both  locally  and  internationally.    However,  we  will  require  adequate  fiscal space  and  funding  to  achieve  the  SDGs  and  to  be  able  to  respond  and recover from the health, social and economic implications of the pandemic, in light of high debt-servicing requirements.            The  continued  use  of  measures  of  development  which  do  not  take  into account the full spectrum of vulnerabilities of small island developing states is a major impediment to our efforts to attain the SDGs.  We who live in one of the  most  disaster-prone  regions  of  the  world  are  more  vulnerable  than  our income data suggests.  We  reiterate  today,  that  consideration  of  our  developmental  level  must  be linked to our socio-economic and environmental vulnerabilities. This rationale underpins the basis for a multi-dimensional vulnerability index for SIDS and for the  ongoing  work  by  the  UN  on  this  matter,  as  endorsed  by  the  General Assembly last year.  Mr President, The Caribbean Development Bank has reported that SIDS debts have risen to unsustainable  levels  since  the  pandemic.    The  number  of  Caribbean countries with a debt to GDP ratio above % has increased from  to  with the average debt to GDP ratio increasing to %.   Jamaica  maintains  its  call  for  a  revision  of  the  graduation  criteria,  as  the classification  system  utilized  by  international  financial  institutions  is  simply  not appropriate. We concur with the UN Secretary General in his assessment, that graduation must be a reward, not a punishment. As we strive to build forward stronger  in  this  decade  of  action,  we  call  for  the  commitment  of  the international  community  to  a  post  Covid-  reality  that  guarantees  greater investment and financing  to support development  and economic growth in SIDS.  We  also  seek  the  reorientation  of  the  international  financial  system  to align  financing  with  sustainable  development  to  accelerate  our  push  to achieve our SDG Goals.           Climate Change and Economic Vulnerabilities Mr. President,  Climate  change  remains  one  of  the  defining  global  challenges  of  our  era and  of  even  greater  concern  for  future  generations.  Our  ability  to  achieve sustainable development will be compromised if we do not find real solutions to the ongoing climate emergency.   The demand for climate adaptation is increasing, but so is the fear that it will be unmet.  A more worrisome truth is the IPCC’s finding that human influence on  the  earth’s  climate  has  already  led  to  unprecedented  and  irreversible changes.    In  their  efforts  to  combat  these  changes,  SIDS  have  been unable to access climate finance at the pace and scale necessary.  We  have  instead,  been  forced  to  spend  significant  funds  on  loss  and damage, with limited financial support from large emitters. Jamaica joins with all SIDS in calling for delivery of the 100 billion dollars per annum, committed in 2015, by the international donor community.   COP-  must  deliver  significant  progress  on  the  priority  issues  of  climate financing,  loss  and  damage,  adaptation  and  mitigation,  as  well  as  the development of effective climate change plans.   Mr President, The  UN  Convention  on  the  Law  of  the  Sea  recognises  the  ocean  as  the common heritage of mankind. As the science and the research have shown, we  must  also  see  the  oceans  as  playing  a  vital  role  as  a  climate  mitigator.  We support the development of a legally binding international instrument on the  conservation  and  sustainable  use  of  marine  biological  diversity  in  areas         beyond national jurisdiction.  We look forward to the successful conclusion of negotiations of an international Treaty under the Convention, in 2022. Threats to International Peace and Security Mr President, We reaffirm the importance of multilateral approaches to the issues of peace and  development,  and  the  central  role  of  the  United  Nations  in  their treatment.  We support the resolution of disputes, whether in the Middle East, in the  Caribbean  or  elsewhere, through  dialogue  and  negotiated settlements.    We  call  for  the  end  to  the  economic,  commercial  and  financial  embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba.   Mr President, The  illicit  proliferation  of  small  arms  and  light  weapons  remains  a  daily challenge  to  citizen  security  and  a  grave  concern  to  Jamaica.    The widespread  availability  of  these  arms  and  their  ammunition  is  a  key  enabler of  conflict  and  endemic  crime,  and  represent  a  significant  danger  to  our internal security, fostering criminal activities which destabilize the social order.  We will work with all our partners to enhance the capacity of member states to address issues related to arms control and disarmament, by preventing the diversion  of  conventional  arms  to  the  illicit  market.    This  matter  remains  a priority  for  Jamaica,  as  we seek  the  assistance  of  our  bilateral,  regional  and international partners in addressing the issue.            Mr President, The celebration of the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations, recognized the pivotal  role  of  the  Organization,  to  which  we  continue  to  assign  new mandates  and  challenges.    Let  us,  with  equal  fervor,  resolve  to  equip  the Organization with the necessary tools and financial resources, to enable it to effectively  undertake  its  leadership  role  in  safeguarding  international  peace and  security,  and  in  ensuring  the  economic  and  social  well-being  of mankind. Our common vision must be one in which the UN can act, and will act, as the catalyst for hope, for change, for peace and as an instrument of progress on behalf of all peoples of the world. Thank you.      "
33,2021,KNA,Saint Kitts and Nevis,"President, Mr. Secretary General, Distinguished delegates, It  is  my  privilege  and  honour  to  address  the  United  Nations  General  Assembly today. On behalf of the people of St. Kitts and Nevis, I extend my congratulations to His Excellency  Abdulla  Shahid  of  the  Maldives,  the  Foreign  Minister  of  a  similar Small Island Developing State, on his election to the Presidency of the 76th Session of the UN General Assembly. I thank his predecessor for his valuable work during the 75th Session and also take this  opportunity  to  congratulate  UN  Secretary  General  Antonio  Guterres  for securing a second term. I  pay  tribute  to  the  diligence,  commitment,  and  perseverance  he  has  shown  in steering the UN family as best as possible through the pandemic. The theme of this General Assembly debate is fitting. It reminds us that we must keep faith in multilateralism and international cooperation to achieve our goals and rebuild sustainably. The  past    months  have  challenged  everyone,  everywhere,  yet  here  we  are  - convening  once  more  as  a  General  Assembly  -  to  find  global  solutions  to  global problems. Health and COVID- pandemic The  battle  against  COVID-  is  not  yet  won,  and  its  devastating  impact  on  our societies and economies continues. We  believe  strongly  that  no  one  is  safe  until  everyone  is  safe,  that  requires equitable access to vaccines and other medical products and technologies.   I commend the international community for its response to calls for vaccine equity and am pleased to say that St. Kitts and Nevis is just one of the many countries to have  benefitted  from  the  COVAX  facility  established  by  the  World  Health Organisation  at  the  start  of  the  pandemic.    I  also  wish  to  thank  our  bilateral partners for their generosity in providing us with vaccines. St. Kitts and Nevis has  percent of its adult population fully vaccinated and over   percent  of  the  target  population  has  received  the  first  dose.    We  are endeavouring to improve these statistics in the near future.  Our citizens responded selflessly to our calls for social distancing and adhered to other  COVID-  protocols,  playing  an  active  role  in  curbing  the  COVID- pandemic and helping to overcome community spread. Healthy  lifestyles  remain  a  central  element  in  our  fight  against  COVID-, particularly as we continue to prioritise the delivery of health care to people living with non-communicable diseases who, given their higher risk are most vulnerable to the disease. The  need  to  continue  investing  in  a  resilient  health  system  and  comprehensive public  health  services  is  paramount.  Mental  health  and  wellbeing  are  also  vital, which  is  why  we  delivered  a  comprehensive  mental  health  plan  to  provide psychosocial support through the National Counselling Center. Sadly, the economic impact of the pandemic will be felt for years to come. When it began,  tourism  our  biggest  economic  driver  ground  to  a  halt,  causing  significant unemployment  and  underemployment.  Businesses  suffered  as  a  result  of lockdowns. We  took  action,  providing  social  protection  programmes  for  those  in  need.    We implemented an EC $120 million COVID- stimulus package, reduced corporate   income  tax  for  employers  who  retained  %  of  their  workforce,  and  introduced VAT and import duty waivers for pandemic related products.  Climate Change The  impact  of  COVID-  on  development  more  widely,  in  particular  the  2030 Sustainable  Development  Goals,  has  also  been significant  but  instead  of  walking away from them we need to work, collectively, even harder to achieve them. Climate  change  and  climate-related  events  continue  to  threaten  the  existence  of Small Island Development States such as ours.  As the climate crisis intensifies, we witness  the  erosion  of  coasts  owing  to  rising  sea  levels;  fisherfolk  struggling  to maintain  their  livelihoods  from  waning  oceanic  diversity;  families  forced  to relocate away from coastal areas due to the strength, intensity and relentlessness of each passing hurricane season. Sustainable Development Goals ,  and  are of particular significance as they require us, among other things, to improve education and awareness of - as well as human and institutional capacity on - climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning. ICT and Bridging the Digital Divide A less negative outcome of the pandemic has been its effect in turbo-charging the digitization  of  our  workplaces  and  societies.  But  not  all  countries  –  particularly Small  Island Developing  States  -  have  the  infrastructure,  capacity  and workforce skills to fully benefit from this revolution. Rebuilding sustainably requires us to re-evaluate digital accessibility, affordability, and  technical  assistance  so  that  every  country  regardless  of  income  level  or   geographic  location  can  exploit  the  digital  economy  in  one  properly  networked world. GDP per capita as the benchmark for development Another barrier to development that we face is the criteria employed to determine aid  and  financial  support.  The  singular  benchmark  for  measuring  development  - GDP  per  capita  -  is critical  but  sadly,  due  to bias and  the omission  of factors,  is simplistic and flawed. For  St.  Kitts  and  Nevis  it  ignores  vulnerabilities  and  prevents  us  from  accessing critical  development  assistance.  A  set  of  more  adequate  and  relevant  measures  - encompassing social, environmental/climate-related and economic factors – should be  used  to  regulate  entitlements.    The  use  of  a  Multidimensional  Vulnerability Index, for example, would be a far better judge of development than simply GDP per capita. Small Arms and Light Weapons The  protection  of  life  from  violent  crime  is  also  of  fundamental  importance  and discussions  surrounding  Small  Arms  and  Light  Weapons  remain  critical  to  our democracy.    Our  position  remains  that  the  uncontrolled  proliferation  of the  illicit trade of Small Arms and Light Weapons has significant impacts on the health and well-being,  socio-economic  development,  human  rights  and  human  development of every citizen in the world. The new challenges faced as a result of technological developments must also be taken  into  consideration  and  confronted.  We  will  also  continue  to  lend  our  voice and support to the work of the United Nations with a view to bringing about an end to the misery caused by these weapons.    Partnerships St.  Kitts  and  Nevis  prides  itself  on  continuing  to  build  strong  alliances  and increasingly expand our international footprint. Our diplomatic ties are founded on mutual  respect  for  and  adherence  to  the  United  Nations  Charter,  the  rule  of international law and on the appreciation of the value of human life and dignity.  For  this  reason,  I  call  for  the  lifting  of  the  economic,  commercial,  and  financial embargo  against  Cuba,  and  I  note  the  incalculable  damage  it  causes.  During  the last four years, the blockade against Cuba has been reinforced with more than 240 coercive  economic  actions  and  measures,  reaching  unprecedented  levels  of hostility.  The  Government  and  people  of  Cuba  have  contributed  much  to  my country,  the  Caribbean,  and  the  world,  especially  during  these  unprecedented times.  One can only imagine the potential of their contribution to the international community were the embargo lifted.  Furthermore, I cannot address this august body and not  recognise our dear friend the  Republic  of  China  (Taiwan).  St.  Kitts  and  Nevis  again  renews  its  call  for Taiwan’s  inclusion  in  the  international  community.  We  strongly  believe  Taiwan has  an  important  and  continuing  role  to  play  in  international  development strategies given their great success in many areas. Taiwan has demonstrated that it can  be  a  true  partner  in  health,  and  we  have  seen  its  exemplary  response  to  the pandemic firsthand in St. Kitts and Nevis and other parts of the world.    My  country  looks  forward  to  Taiwan  being  included  in  the  UN  system  and  its meetings, mechanisms, and activities.  Reparations St. Kitts and Nevis is pleased that a few days ago, we met to commemorate the 20th Anniversary of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. It is important   for  the  world  to  be  united  against  racism,  racial  discrimination,  xenophobia  and related intolerance.  Untold suffering and evil were inflicted on millions of men, women and children of  African  descent,  as  a  result  of  the  transatlantic  slave  trade,  colonialism, apartheid  and  many  of  the  other  ills  of  our  history  and  other  crimes  against humanity.   We  welcome  the  establishment  of  the  Permanent  Forum  for  People  of  African Descent,  which  will  serve  as  a  consultation  mechanism  for  people  of  African descent  and  other  interested  stakeholders,  and  as  a  platform  for  improving  the quality of life and livelihoods of people of African descent.  We make, as other CARICOM Heads of Governments did in 2013, a clarion call for  reparations  and  reparatory  justice.  We  subsequently  formed  the  CARICOM Reparations Committee and the establishment of the -point plan that outlines the path to reconciliation and justice for victims of crimes against humanity and their descendants.  We hope that this meeting has invoked a renewed momentum to pursue action to right the wrongs that are still manifested today. Conclusion In conclusion. We  are  all  in  this  together;  my  hope  is  that  we  will  emerge  from  COVID- stronger and more united than before. There is no better place than the General Assembly to forge a positive consensus in order to build a better future for our children, our grandchildren, and their children.   We are living in unprecedented times, and we have responded admirably so far.But we  must  continue  to  be  proactive,  relentless,  resilient,  and  willing  to  share  our ideas and resources as members of the same brotherhood of nations. We look therefore to the future with hope and with great expectation.  Thank you.    "
34,2021,LCA,Saint Lucia,"President,  colleague  Heads  of  Government  and  Foreign  Ministers,  Country  Representatives,  and members of country delegations, I bring you warm greetings from the most beautiful piece of territory on Earth, the sovereign state of Saint Lucia. Mr. President, I am honoured to address this body for the first time, as the Prime Minister of Saint Lucia. It was my privilege to lead my party into general elections less than two months ago, and to have witnessed the people of my country continue to uphold and nurture the deep democratic traditions of our Caribbean by giving my party an overwhelming mandate to govern Saint Lucia for the next five () years. I wish to pledge  to  the  international  community,  that  under  my  leadership  Saint  Lucia’s  intention  to  uphold  the highest  traditions  of  universal  brotherhood,  the  pursuit  of  mutually  beneficial  goals,  respect  for  all peoples and cultures, and the recognition and respect of the sovereignty of all member states of the United Nations. Mr. President, permit me to join other colleagues in extending congratulations to you, on your elevation to the  Presidency  of  this  vital  and  crucial  catalyst  of  global  development  -  the  United  Nations  General Assembly (UNGA).  It is our sincere hope and our profound expectation that your tenure will be marked by thoughtful  and  tangible  action,  given  the  global  challenges  that  confront us  as  UN  Member  States,  and given that our very lives and continued existence as peoples and as a planet are directly threatened by the issues now confronting us. Since Saint Lucia joined the United Nations in 1979, we have always prided ourselves on our principled positions in matters of foreign policy. If there were any recent doubts about St. Lucia’s adherence to these basic principles, I am here  to reassure  you that Saint  Lucia subscribes fully to, and stands firmly on, the principle of non-interference in the internal politics of nations. In pursuit of our Sustainable Development Goals, we shall be, in the words of Barbados’ Independence pioneer and late Prime Minister - The Right Honourable  Errol  Walton  Barrow  –  “friends  of  all  but satellites  of  none.”  We  shall  as  much  as  possible engage in foreign policy coordination with our CARICOM and OECS partners, and our relationships shall continue  to  be  based  on  mutual  respect. Saint  Lucia  will  not  sacrifice  these  principles  on  the  altar  of convenient, short-term, and temporary alliances  with great powers whose  shifting global  stances  may or may  not  coincide  with  Saint  Lucia’s  permanent  insistence  on  being  a  mutually  respected  regional development partner. Mr. President, I must confess that our excitement at the opportunity to sensitise the global community to Saint Lucia’s perspective on the issues confronting before this respected body, has been tempered by the frustrating  realization  that,  if  I may borrow  an  idiom  from  one  of  my fellow CARICOM  Member States, “we  are  spinning  top  in  mud  or  we  are  going  around  in  circles.”  I  say this  Mr.  President  because,  in perusing the contribution delivered to this body by Saint Lucia in 2015, I was struck by the similarity of the concerns raised then to the concerns confronting us today, in 2021. Mr. President, the date, the names, and the faces have changed, but the issues remain the same.         It is not my intention to question the modus operandi of this honourable institution, because the evidence confirming the good work of the United Nations, is undeniable. However, Mr. President, Saint Lucia cannot pretend  to  be  unconcerned  by  the  fact  that  Small  Island  Developing  States  (SIDS)  like  Saint  Lucia continues to suffer from a number of challenges, arising out of our smallness, our island existence, and our vulnerability to natural disasters and climate change. However, while we struggle to formulate solutions for  these  ills,  we  have  been  confronted  with  the  novel  coronavirus  COVID-.  While  its  novelty  and evolving character are baffling, COVID-  has enlarged and worsened the issues confronting SIDS. In this sense Mr. President we are now being inundated by the new, while still being overwhelmed by the old. Mr.  President,  we  continue  to  contend  with  the  near-impossible  balancing  act  of  preserving  lives  and livelihoods.  The  insidious  nature  of  the  virus  has  allowed  it  to  sneak  across  even  the  most  heavily patrolled borders, and Saint Lucia has experienced waves of highs and lows in managing this pandemic. In that regard, we extend our deepest gratitude to international institutions such as the COVAX Facility, and our many bilateral partners such as India and the United States of America, for their commitment to ensuring that we in Saint Lucia and by extension the Caribbean region, were not further disadvantaged by our inability to access vaccines. Mr.  President,  as  we  battle  this  pandemic,  there  is  another  global  threat  that  runs  parallel  to  it,  by  the name  of  “misinformation.”  The  Government  of  Saint  Lucia  has  embarked  upon  a  robust  education programme to encourage our population to get vaccinated, as realistically, this is the only way to reduce, eliminate and  eradicate  the  risks and restrictions  caused  by this pandemic,  and permit us to rebuild  our economies and societies, stronger. However, we have witnessed in dismay the politics at play even in the midst  of  this  pandemic,  as  various  countries  create  their  lists  of  recognized and unrecognized vaccines, with certain privileges awarded to global citizens who have opted for certain branded vaccines over others. We  have  witnessed  vaccine  apartheid  in  various  forms  and  not  only  in  terms  of  production  and distribution.  Some countries which have stockpiled vaccines are now in the middle of debates about third doses and  boosters,  while  other countries  watch  helplessly as COVID-related deaths continue to rise for want of a jab. Mr. President, in Saint Lucia, we recognize all vaccines that are endorsed and administered by a country’s respective  government,  as  we  have  entrusted  sovereign  states  with  the  responsibility  of following  the science. In this regard, we call for standardization of vaccine privileges across the global community, as it relates to quarantine, isolation, and other related requirements. Saint Lucia, like many other countries, is grappling with a decline in investment, trade, remittances, and growing  debt  burdens.  There  is  an  urgent  need  to  accelerate  global  momentum  towards  the  ambitious targets across various international agreements and development agendas. A common thread across these instruments  is  the  need  to  address  the  unique  vulnerabilities  and  special  circumstances  of  SIDS.  Saint Lucia and all SIDS, continue to face huge spending needs to finance the immediate health responses, that are well beyond our capacities. Such a shift of focus will reverse achievements in Sustainable Development        Goals (SDG) implementation and in building climate resilience. Therefore,  Saint  Lucia  stands  in  solidarity  with  all  SIDS,  in  calling  for  an  abolition  of  current  classical economics  criteria  for  accessing  concessional  development  finance.  These  indicators  erroneously  paint  a picture of “national prosperity” that lies in stark contrast to existing realities.  Mr.  President,  Saint  Lucia  is  calling  for  the  adoption  of  a  global  vulnerability  index  by  international institutions.  This  index  should  include  variables  such  as  vulnerability  to  adverse  weather  systems  and natural  disasters,  historical  disadvantages  arising  out  of  plunder,  colonialism and  exploitation,  and  the vagaries of the economic activities which such states depend for survival. Such a global vulnerability index would  ensure  that  access  to  concessional  development  finance  is  granted  based  on  criteria  that  consider the true contexts of our fragile economies, which are constantly under threat of regression, due to natural, man-made or political disasters. Saint  Lucia  also  calls  for  immediate  measures  to  safeguard  the  solvency  of  SIDS  -  which  have  been disproportionately  affected  during  the  pandemic.  These  measures  must  include  debt  restructuring  and write-off,  support  to  strengthen  health  systems,  more  equitable  distribution  and  access  to  vaccines,  and assistance  for  recovery  that  meets  the  demands  of  the  development  model adopted  in  the  beneficiary country, and is consistent with our current socio-economic environment. Mr. President, the pandemic seems to have slowed down everything but the deterioration of our beloved planet earth. Climate change continues to wreak havoc across all areas of the globe. While COVID- now grabs the headlines, it is a fact that the pandemic emerged at a time when the World was already on an unsustainable  path  towards  the  2030  Agenda  and  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals.  With  less  than  a decade  left  to  achieve  the  2030  Agenda,  the  UN’s  Decade  of  Delivery  requires  urgent  and  adequate solutions  towards  salvaging  our  global  living  quarters.  The  resilience  we  need,  and  the  adaptations required  system-wide  to  respond  to  Covid-;  are  directly  relevant  to  the  resilience  and  adaptation required  for  climate  change.  It  can  be  argued  that  the  Covid-  pandemic  and  the  climate  change challenge  confronts  us  with  an  intermeshed  problem  of  symptom  as  cause  and  cause  as  symptom.  It provides us with a harsh and timely reminder that human health and planetary health are linked. Sadly, Mr. President, the cost of meeting these challenges and undertaking the resilience activities, whether it be for health or climate, is way beyond the financial reach of our small islands. We, therefore, appeal to all,  especially  those  ablest  financially,  to  contribute  towards  our  recovery  efforts,  and  to  pay  their commitments to the Adaptation and Mitigation Funds, so that SIDS can benefit. On  the  eve  of  COP26,  we  encourage  the  larger  economies,  the  often-major  contributors  to  greenhouse gases,  to  honour  their  financial  pledges.  This  would  allow  us,  the  smaller  vulnerable economies,  whose contributions to greenhouse gases are often negligible, the fiscal room to build climate-resilient societies. Mr.  President,  as  we  maneuver  the  turmoil  of  these  unprecedented  times,  the  young  people  must  be brought into the mainstream of national development. Too often, the Youth are placed on the back burner         when things get rough, and the belt used for economic tightening is strung around their very necks. Such an approach fails to consider the immense energy, enthusiasm, and creativity which young people bring to the  development  table.  It  is  for  this  reason,  that  Saint  Lucia has  prioritized  the  implementation  of  “The Youth  Economy,”  as  the  new  frontier  of  our  economic development,  formalized  in  a  new  Government Department under the purview of the Prime Minister, with the mandate of propelling our young people to turn  their  talents,  skills  and  hobbies into  economic  enterprises  for  their  own  empowerment.  We  see  our young  people  as  a  resource  to be  molded  and  optimized,  not  as  problems  to  be  managed  or  solved.  We believe that a country must consider the aspirations of its young citizens and turn them into concrete and practical assets, purposes and goals. Mr.  President,  we  are  committed  to  improving  the  lives  of  our  young  people,  especially  the  most vulnerable,  and  we  are  working  with  all  citizens  to  assist  them  in  transforming  their  lives  and  to  make viable  contributions  to  the  economy.  In  this  regard,  Saint  Lucia  invites  the  International  Community  to discuss and engage with us strategically, on mutually beneficial relationships and projects to promote The Youth Economy, as we seek to build a better and more sustainable future for all. Mr. President, Saint Lucia remains among a handful of countries that maintain official relations with the Government of the Republic of China (Taiwan). We continue to plead the case to advance their cause to be accepted as a legitimate participant in the global decision-making process. Mr.  President,  the  development  of  Saint  Lucia  will  continue  to  be  compromised,  as  long  as  the development of our sister nation of Cuba continues to be frustrated by global political considerations. In this regard. Mr. President, Saint Lucia encourages a revisiting of the chapter in history not too long ago, where diplomatic reconciliation had commenced between the United States of America and the Republic of Cuba, under the Obama-Biden administration. In fact, then- Vice President Biden was the chief envoy of the United  States  to  Cuba,  and  it  would  be  a  signal  achievement,  if  as  President  of  the  Biden-Harris administration,  he  was  to  bring  his  work  on  Cuba to  its  logical  conclusion,  with  the  normalization  of relations. Cuba  continues  to  punch  above  its  weight  with  its  humanitarian  efforts,  playing  its  part  in  the  global Covid- response, despite its disadvantaged position in the International Community. Saint Lucia joins CARICOM and the global community in renewing calls to the United States to normalize its relations with Cuba, and for the abolition of the existing embargo, which only serves as a hindrance to economic growth in  Cuba,  and  an  obstacle  to  realizing  full  regional  economic  integration  in  the  Caribbean.  Given  Cuba’s role in health, education, sports, and social development in our region, the normalisation of relations with Cuba,  means  the  advancement  of  development  in  our  entire  Caribbean  region.  As  we  make  this  annual call for the normalisation of relations with Cuba, Saint Lucia wants it to be known that we are speaking to our own development in as much as we are speaking about the betterment of the lives of the Cuban people. At a time when we are experiencing global turmoil, it is important for good sense to prevail, and for the         world to fully embrace the immense expertise and resources  which the Cuban  people have to offer. It is more than overdue for us to make right this grave injustice to Cuba that has deliberately cut them off from the global supply chain. The continuation of this embargo in 2021 is unconscionable. Mr. President, the situation in Venezuela concerns Saint Lucia tremendously. As one of the first nations to establish diplomatic relations with Saint Lucia after we gained Independence in 1979, and as a beneficiary of  Venezuelan  economic  cooperation,  Saint  Lucia  considers  Venezuela  a  loyal and  legitimate  friend  and partner. The virtual economic blockade which has been imposed on the democratically elected government of Venezuela by a few big and powerful countries is unacceptable in this international system. It is even more  outrageous,  that  prominent  members  of  this  international  system,  who  pride  themselves  on  their democratic  traditions,  have  sought  to  recognize  an  alternative  President  who  did  not  even  contest elections,  and  who  has  no  political  legitimacy  whatsoever.  Further,  the  act  of  seizing  and  freezing Venezuelan Government gold, cash, and assets, while preventing access by the Venezuelan people to basic food,  medicines,  and  supplies  during  this  pandemic,  could  quite  conceivably  qualify  as  modern-day piracy,  economic  terrorism,  and  crimes  against  humanity.  Saint  Lucia  and  CARICOM  cannot  in  good conscience continue to be part of this unjust attack against the Venezuelan people. Mr. President,  as  I conclude,  I again  call  for  urgent  consideration  of the  harsh  reality and the  many and continuing challenges confronting SIDS like Saint Lucia.  Mr. President, now is the time for a change, the time to act, the time to overcome our challenges through global solidarity and mutual assistance. The future of every nation and country is at risk, we need the global economy to work for the % and not just the wealthy and powerful %. Mr. President, I appeal to the International community to remain focused on working in partnership with SIDS like Saint Lucia. For the balanced development  of the  global community,  we need the powerful to behave responsibly and cooperate more effectively to enable a more inclusive and sustainable humanity for all, and to ensure that no one is left behind. Caribbean  countries  like  ours  which  were  exploited  and  underdeveloped  to  finance  the  development  of Europe, have put forward a case for reparations for slavery and native genocide, and we expect that case to  be  treated  with  the  seriousness  and  urgency  it  deserves.  There  should  be  no  double-standards  in  the international system in recognizing acknowledging and compensating victims of crimes against humanity. And so, Saint Lucia urges that the principles which have applied to other victims of mass slavery and such forms of exploitation, be applied with equal force and sincerity and seriousness of purpose to Caribbean nations who suffered more than three centuries of slavery and native genocide between 1492 and 1838, by the  colonizing  powers  of  Europe.  Saint  Lucia  fully  endorses  the  stance  of  the  CARICOM’s  reparations Commission that our:          “Reparations Movement is a  moral, legal and political  response to the crimes against humanity committed during the European imperial project – specifically the genocide against the native population and the trading and enslavement of enchained bodies of Africans."" Mr. President, as  one  of our Local Laureates – Robert Lee  penned – Saint Lucia is a State, Not a real estate, Not plantation estate. This is an open wound crying out for justice, healing, compassion, and closure, and it continues to fester with  every  decree  or  decision  of  the  OECD  and  such  other  groupings.  If  the  international  system  is  to work fairly for all nations, wrong cannot continue to be strong and might cannot continue to be right. Let us, therefore, return to our core principles of peace, harmony, fairness, tolerance, and non-interference in the  internal  politics  of  sovereign  states.  Let  us  be  guided  by  the golden  chord  of  mutual  respect  and universal  fraternity,  particularly  in  these  perilous  times  which demand  that  we  recognise  our  common humanity above anything else. Mr. President, I continue to believe in dialogue, inclusion, fairness, and a common humanity. Saint Lucia is confident in your leadership of this august body, and Saint Lucia is assured, that under our joint effort, we can transform the words of the theme of our meeting, into our lived reality and we will successfully build resilience  through  hope  to  recover  from  COVID-,  we  will  rebuild  sustainably  by  responding appropriately to the needs of the planet, we will respect the rights of all peoples, and we will revitalise the United Nations, so that it can reflect the highest and most noble principles upon which it was founded. Mr, President, I end with a verse from Love After Love by Nobel Laureate and Saint Lucian son,  Sir Derek Walcott –  “The time will come  when, with elation  you will greet yourself arriving  at your own door, in your own mirror  and each will smile at the other's welcome” We work towards this goal. I Thank You.           "
35,2021,VCT,Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,"President, Excellencies: We are convened at this 76th Session of the United Nations’ General Assembly  at  a  time  of  severe  health,  socio-economic,  political, climatic, and security challenges, globally, though unevenly, not in equal measure.  The raging pandemic of COVID-, which came upon us early last year, has put the world in a veritable tailspin, even as the  roll-out  of  the  vaccines  has  eased  the  strain  somewhat, particularly  in  the  developed  world.    A  major shift  has  occurred  in the  global condition;  a  parallelogram  of  unruly  and complex  forces has  been  unleashed;  a  new  paradigm  has  emerged;  out-moded approaches  are  becoming,  or  have  become,  irrelevant;  fresh initiatives  and  directions  are  required;  and  transformational leadership is needed, now more than ever. In  my  country,  St.  Vincent  and  the  Grenadines,  a  small-island developing state with all its historical legacies of under-development and  contemporary  burdens  and  limitations,  has  had  to  cope, additionally,  with  the  devastating volcanic  eruptions  of  April  2021, the  on-rushing  Atlantic  Hurricane  season,  vaccine  hesitance  | P a g e     amongst  the  population,  and  real  uncertainty  about  the  future.  Amidst  all  this,  our  people  are  nevertheless  possessed  of  a  settled resilience  and  optimism  of  life  and  living,  undergirded  by  God’s redemptive  grace,  our  own  possibilities  and  strengths,  a  sterling regional solidarity, and promising internationalist support, inclusive of that of our United Nations, for peace and security, good health and prosperity for our people, as pledged in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Immediately,  all  of  us  in  this  global  family  of  nations,  must  work together  to  defeat  COVID-,  return  to  an  acceptable  level  of normalcy and the opening up of our economies.  This represents a many-sided and enormous challenge of historic proportions in both diagnosis and prescription.  A huge bundle of pre-existing, divisive and  debilitating  conditions  ought  to  be  efficaciously  addressed; historic  wrongs  ought  to  be  righted;  and  extant  and  emergent limitations  and  weaknesses,  real  or  contrived,  require  appropriate correctives.  The metaphoric lions and lionesses, globally, ought to converse  with  each  other  meaningfully,  rather  than  hanker  for perpetual disorder, insecurity, and war; they do not actually need to  | P a g e    lay  down  with  each  other  in  joyous  embrace;  they  ought  simply  to resolve their  differences,  whether  ancient  or  modern;  and compromise,  where  necessary  and  desirable,  in  the  interest  of  all.  But for the sake of humanity, let us drop the vaunted self-interests, the vanities, and divisiveness — real or imagined, and work together, for the better.  These  are  the  ennobling  impulses  which  prompted  the  ancient prophets  and  teachers  of  all  the  world’s  monotheistic  religions  to summon their peoples, and their better angels, to uplifting purposes in this our Earthly City.  These have been the civilising sentiments expressed, from time immemorial, in the voices of wise Emperors and thoughtful  warriors.  These  are  humanity’s  core  values  which constitute the bedrock upon which our United Nations organisation was  originally  built,  and  has  been  henceforth  sustained.    Faith  in them, and accompanying works, will see us through these troubling times in which it appears that things are falling apart and the centre cannot hold.  | P a g e     The  COVID-  pandemic  has  put  the  global  community  at  the critical,  proverbial  crossroads.    What  is  to  be  done?    First,  let  us recognise, and internalise, the novel, historic juncture at which we are,  and  accept,  generally,  the  sage  poetic  advice  that  two  roads diverge in the woods; and we ought to take the one least travelled by; and  that  will  make  all  the  difference.”    This  will  not  be  easy  for historic combatants or contemporary rivals to do; but it is the only choice that humanity has. In  tackling  the  pandemic  itself,  the  old  ways  have  tended  to  pre-dominate,  even  as  the  sunlit  rays  of  a  possible  new  path  have emerged.   Thus, for  example,  globally,  we  have  witnessed unacceptable vaccine nationalism; the politicisation of the roll-out of the  vaccines;  and  the  roll-out of  vaccines  for  the rich  first  and  the poor  afterwards.    To  be  sure,  we  have  also  witnessed  notable,  and noble,  work  by  some  global  institutions  such  as  the  World  Health Organisation,  the  World  Bank,  and  the  COVAX  Facility,  to  make vaccines more accessible to poor or marginalised countries.  | P a g e     It is true, too, though relatively late in day, that some rich countries in the North Atlantic (USA, Canada, and the United Kingdom) have delivered or agreed to deliver, freely, from their surpluses, vaccines to some less developed countries; we are very grateful.  Still, though, some of these countries may be so slow in their promised deliveries that  they  may  end  up,  embarrassingly,  with  expired  doses  of  the vaccines running into several millions.  It is timely to remind all of us that the noblest form of solidarity is to give not from the abundance or surplus that we may have but from the little that we possess; that is the lesson of the proverbial widow’s mite.  In this regard, on behalf of the Caribbean, I thank the government of the Republic of India for their early, and meaningful gift of Covishield Astrazeneca vaccines.  Sadly,  at  least  one  country  in  the  North  Atlantic  has  refused  to recognise Covishield for entry of persons into that country. Mr. President, not only have the ways of the old order, pre-COVID, tended, still, to guide powerful countries in their actions; so, too, the behemoths in global communications.  These entities, enveloped in mega profits and profiteering, own and control the various internet platforms,  with  little  or  no  public  regulation,  and  have  ignored  or  | P a g e    abandoned  any  real  sense  of  responsibility  for  the  anti-vax misinformation and disinformation which occupy cyberspace.  As a consequence,  real  people  die  in  their  multitudes  across  the  world.  Surely, this irresponsibility must stop! Surely, too, many ancient and long-standing political quarrels ought to come to an end in these new, perilous times which humanity faces.  At the top of the list ,must undoubtedly include:  The refusal of Israel and its international backers to come to terms with the requisite of an  independent  Palestine,  and  a  secure  Israel,  in  accord  with repeated resolutions of this august body; and, similarly,  the refusal of  the  United  States  of  America  to  dismantle  the  internationally unlawful, and crippling, economic blockade of Cuba, and to bring to an  end  the  unjust,  harsh,  unilateral  economic  and  financial sanctions against Venezuela and, to a lesser extent, Nicaragua. So,  too,  it  is  high  time  for  this  United  Nations  and  its  agencies  to cease  their  exclusion  of  Taiwan  from  meaningful  participation.  Surely, the world will benefit from Taiwan’s inclusion in global bodes such as the World Health Assembly, the United Nations Framework  | P a g e     Convention  on  Climate  Change,  the  International  Civil  Aviation Organisation, and INTERPOL.  Concerted, multi-lateral cooperation on  global  matters  such  as  health,  climate  change,  civil  aviation, crime,  and  so  forth  requires  all  hands-on  deck,  metaphorically speaking.    Taiwan  is  a  relatively  small,  but  legitimate,  political expression  of  the  magnificent  Chinese  civilisation;  it  has  been  an impressive economic miracle; it is a thriving democracy; and it has a right  to  ask  for  meaningful  inclusion  in  the  relevant  global institutions.  New times demand fresh solutions, not old-fashioned hegemonic responses. By now, Mr. President, the folly of invading and seeking to remake countries in an invader’s image and likeness is plain for all to see in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere.  The human and economic costs are  staggering.    Still,  though,  the  values  of  our  United  Nations demand  that  women  must  be  respected  and  empowered,  that religious  discrimination  must  be  rejected, that theocracies accommodate  competing  voices,  and  that  terrorism  and  political violence be not embedded in any statecraft. The sacred principles of non-intervention  and  non-interference  ought  not  to  be  blind,  | P a g e    perpetually or at all, to unacceptable and egregious excesses against humanity. Mr. President, a looming ecological disaster awaits humanity unless we change course, for the better.  No serious person who objectively examines the scientific data can but conclude that climate change is an  existential  threat  to  humanity,  and  especially  to  Small  Island Developing States (SIDS) and countries, such as in West Africa and the  Sahel  region,  which  are  being  swept  into  seemingly  unending natural  disasters  as  a  consequence  of  desertification  and  extreme land degradation.  Science, the real world, and the Paris Accord have pointed  to  alternative  pathways  for  humanity  but  the  political  will and requisite resources from the major emitters to address the grave challenge  of  climate  change  have  not  gone  much  beyond  pious mouthings and marginal tinkering.  St. Vincent and the Grenadines is hoping for the best at the Conference of Parties (COP) in Glasgow in November 2021, but we fear the worst — more procrastination and the ducking of serious responsibility by the major emitters.  On this, humanity is at the midnight hour.  Can we meet the challenge?  We may not live to find out the answer if the usual continues.  | P a g e    Mr. President, there is a range of other pressing concerns relevant to the  Caribbean  that  demand  urgent,  global,  multi-lateral  action.  These  include:    Meaningful  debt  restructuring  and  a  favourable reform  of  the  global  financial  architecture;  the  replacing  of  certain wrong-headed  criteria,  such  as  GDP  per  head  of  population,  by  a Vulnerability  Index  to  determine  access  to  development  financing; the cessation of the use of unilateral sanctions and the weaponising of the financial and banking systems against small states, including the  capricious  termination  of  corresponding  banking  relationships; the reversal of the diminution or slow-down of Official Development Assistance  by  rich  countries;  that  Small  Island  Exceptionalism  be accepted  as  a  category  to  be  objectively  embraced  in  efficacious actions on the Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs) and a rules-based  international  order;  the  necessity  and  desirability  for reparatory  justice  from  European  nations  in  respect  of  native genocide and the enslavement of Africans from which the European nations profited systematically and from which, consequentially, our Caribbean  countries  have  suffered  a  legacy  of  under-development;  | P a g e    and  the  urgent  need  for  an  appropriate  multi-lateral  initiative  to assist Haiti, a CARICOM member, in its current peril. Mr. President, at our United Nations, the reform agenda, including that of Security Council reform, demand renewed impetus.  We have been talking about this subject for far too long, and avoiding concrete steps  forward.  St.  Vincent  and  the  Grenadines  recognises  the difficulties at hand but it is evident to all reasonable persons that the stranglehold of “the Permanent Five” on the Security Council ought to be appropriately loosened or broken in these times which are so different than in 1945. St.  Vincent  and  the  Grenadines  has  been  honoured  over  the  past near-two  years  to  sit  as  a  non-permanent  member  of  the  Security Council.  St. Vincent and the Grenadines is the smallest country ever to sit on this esteemed Council.  All objective observers concur that we have carried out our work and responsibilities commendably, and have  contributed  to  the  maintenance  and  advancement  of  peace,  | P a g e     security, and prosperity, globally.  Importantly, St. Vincent and the Grenadines  has  been  a  central  party  to  the  establishment  of      an institutional  nexus  known  as  the  A3  plus  One  (the  three  non-permanent  members from  Africa  plus  St.  Vincent  and  the Grenadines),  as  a  distinctive  voice  for  Africa,  the  Caribbean,  and Latin America.  Long may this nexus continue, especially in this the UN Decade for Peoples of African Descent. Mr. President, The lessons of today mirror many of those lodged in the tiring, and oft-times  tired,  struggles  of  yesteryear.  From  whence,  in  the  still smouldering  ashes  of  global  conflict,  our  forebears  crafted  this multilateral institution called the United Nations to provide hope and stability  to  all  of  humanity.  Yet,  this  labour  is  incomplete.  The pervasive inequalities that defined the pre-COVID political and socio-economic  order  must  not  become  tomorrow's  nightmarish  reality. Instead,  in  this  COVID  era,  we  must  reorganise  ourselves,  locally, regionally,  nationally  and  globally,  in  a  quest  to  provide  peace, security, and development to all countries and peoples, in novel ways  | P a g e     and with fresh initiatives. And let us also, with a renewed sense of urgency and compassion, strive to protect, and improve upon, this planet that we all call home. It is pellucid that of all time, only the future is ours to desecrate.  Our United Nations ought never to  be accomplices in any such desecration. So, I reiterate: We are at historic cross-roads of a special kind.  We must  rise,  collectively,  to  address  sensibly,  the  requisite  fresh imperatives in these, our most challenging, times.   Thank you!  | P a g e      "
36,2021,TTO,Trinidad and Tobago,"President, It is an honour to address this august Assembly of States on this the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly. On behalf of the Government and People of Trinidad and Tobago, I extend congratulations to  you  on  your  election  to  the  Presidency.  My  delegation  is  confident  that  with  your  experience  and  able leadership,  this  crucial  session  will  be  highly  successful  in  advancing  our  work  for  peace,  progress  and sustainability for humankind. Permit me, to also express our gratitude to His Excellency Volkan Bozkir for steering our work during the 75th session. Notwithstanding the innumerable challenges encountered during his presidency, he has effectively advanced a comprehensive framework to ensure the continuity of the work of the United Nations. Mr. President,   I also take the opportunity to congratulate His Excellency Antnio Guterres on his reappointment as Secretary-General. The continuity of his astute leadership serves to ensure that the United Nations remains a critical partner in our aspirations to build back better.  Mr. President, The  COVID-  pandemic  has  laid  bare  the  profound  fragilities  of  our  interconnected  societies  and economies. None among us have escaped severe economic contraction and consequential loss of livelihoods. Most  of  all,  the  heavy  death  toll  has  created  new  and  complex  social  issues  in  our  societies  that  require intervention by governments. We are of the firm belief that multilateralism is the only vehicle by which we can jointly save humanity, safeguard livelihoods, and reenergize our economies.             It is happening right before our very eyes, COVID- has now become a pandemic of the unvaccinated, the  majority  of  whom  live  in  the  Global  South.  As  a  responsible  community  of  nations,  we  ought  to  take immediate measures to ensure equitable access to and distribution of vaccines across this globe. This would be the  only  secure  way  to  protect  our  populations  from  further  demise  and  our  economies  from  further convulsions, as the current situation of vaccine inequity benefits only the virus. In Trinidad and Tobago’s experience, it has proven an uphill battle to source vaccines on the open market due, we were told, to our relatively small size and issues of low demand. Such dismissive and unfair responses really deny the universally accepted principle that every human being, whether they live in the Developed North or the Developing South, is entitled to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health. Recognizing the dire consequences that countries of the Caribbean Community would have to confront, Trinidad and Tobago used its chairmanship of CARICOM to convene a Heads of State and Government Meeting to address the pressing question of vaccine availability. Such is our conviction of the relevance and power of multilateralism, that the Trinidad and Tobago Chairmanship took it one step further and raised with the Director General of the World Health Organisation, the convening of a global summit on vaccine availability.  In the meantime, as a result of diplomatic initiatives taken at the bilateral level, Trinidad and Tobago and other  members  of  the  Caribbean  Community  received  donations  of  WHO-approved  vaccines  from  several Governments. We also received supplies via the COVAX facility and from the African Medical Supplies Platform. The People of Trinidad and Tobago and their Government express once more, their grateful thanks to all those countries and mechanisms whose generous assistance permitted us to scale up an aggressive vaccination campaign.  It  would  be  remiss  of  me  not  to  express  Trinidad  and  Tobago’s  deep  appreciation  for  the  critical leadership  role  continuously  demonstrated  by  the  United  Nations  and  more  specifically,  by  the  WHO  in spearheading the global efforts to combat the COVID- virus.          The  evidence  is  irrefutable  that  human  induced  climate  change,  threatens  the  very  survival  of humankind. Yet greenhouse gas emissions are at record levels, and the devastating impacts of climate change continue  to  worsen,  landing  on  the  doorsteps  of  Small  Island  Developing  States,  sitting  as  they  are,  on  the frontline of this crisis. It is therefore Mr. President, our moral responsibility to ensure the full and effective implementation of the Paris Agreement through credible, concrete, enhanced commitments. The commitment made by developed countries to mobilize one hundred billion dollars annually to support mitigation and adaptation in developing countries must be met. Notwithstanding Trinidad and Tobago’s miniscule contribution to global emissions, we have committed in  our  Nationally  Determined  Contribution  to  a  reduction  in  greenhouse  gas  emissions  of  %  in  the  public transportation sector, and to a cumulative decrease of % in the other main carbon emitting sectors by 2030. Consequently,  these  commitments  would  remove  over  100  million  tonnes  of  carbon  dioxide  from  our atmosphere; placing us among the most ambitious in our region. Even so, we are currently updating our NDC with a view to further increasing our mitigation ambition. We hope that COP  will agree to complete the outstanding issues and to fully operationalise the Paris Agreement on a scale that will support cooperation on mitigation, adaptation and compliance. That approach would  be  in  keeping  with  the  calls  for  more  ambitious  commitments  to  ensure  that  the  .-degree  target remains within our reach. Mr. President, Our acute susceptibility to climate change stems from our inherently complex structural vulnerabilities as Small Island Developing States that trap us in a mire of compounding risks; sentencing us to a cyclical struggle of recovery, rebuilding and redevelopment.         Yet we are told time and time again, that our categorisation as middle and high-income countries render us ineligible to access concessionary finance and development support. It is as if the international system, almost by design, perpetuates the conditions that stifle our hard-earned albeit fragile progress. The need to reassess the eligibility of SIDS for concessional finance, beyond income measures, has been widely acknowledged by the international community for almost three decades. In this regard, Trinidad and Tobago  applauds  the  Secretary-General’s  efforts  in  advancing  the  development  of  a  multidimensional vulnerability  index  that  will  more  accurately  reflect  our  composite  challenges  and  open  the  door  to  SIDS-sensitive financing.  The international economic and financial system must be transformed to better support the most vulnerable countries. Mr. President, We  also  recognize  that  the  increasing  incidence  of  violent  crime      domestically,  bedevils  our  efforts toward achieving sustainable development and the maintenance of the rule of law. Much of this criminal activity derives from the operations of international criminal networks engaged in the illicit trafficking of small arms and increasingly sophisticated weaponry, illegal drugs, money laundering, human trafficking and piracy across our society.   Recognizing its value to us and to the members of CARICOM as a whole, Trinidad and Tobago played a highly constructive role in the process culminating in the adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty. We remain keenly engaged to ensure that the Treaty fully achieves its objectives.  Mr. President, As we reflect on the twentieth anniversary of the tragic events of September 11th in New York, we are reminded of our commitments to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. In this regard, the anti –terrorism act of Trinidad and Tobago establishes a robust legal architecture, including measures for criminal prosecution,  to  detect  and  interrupt  the  financing  of  terrorism,  the  collection  and  sharing  of  information, intelligence and evidence, and the enforcement of targeted financial sanctions in accordance with international law.        Mr. President, What most preoccupies us, is an evident tendency for the entrenchment of a culture of violence in our society; most disturbingly, the prevalence of domestic violence and violence against women and girls. Trinidad and Tobago has therefore begun to create safe spaces for all women and girls and is now accelerating its efforts to change the negative behaviours and gender stereotypes, at all levels. Consequently, amendments to existing legislation on Domestic Violence, Sexual Offences, Child Protection as well as to allow for electronic monitoring of sex offenders were enacted recently, to provide further protection for women and girls.   Mr. President, We are cognizant that in several parts of the world people continue to be systematically denied their fundamental human rights and human dignity. Such violations ought to offend us as a community of nations working to improve the standards of living and welfare of all our peoples. It is therefore necessary that we reject and punish impunity wherever it rears its ugly head.  Accordingly, Trinidad and Tobago remains unwavering in its commitment to the mandate and mission of the International Criminal Court, in the interest of banishing the worst forms of human rights abuses and violations from our civilization. We urge those States which are not yet members of the Court to subscribe to it in order to achieve universality.  Mr. President,  Despite  recent  contusions,  Trinidad  and  Tobago  is  seizing  the  opportunity  to  emerge  stronger and better. As an economy predominantly dependent on the hydrocarbon and petrochemical industries, we  are  sparing  no  effort  to  provide  the  necessary  support  and  the  enabling  environment  to  foster diversification, through substantial transformation in the creative sector as well as in manufacturing, finance, medicine,  security,  commerce,  agriculture  and  renewable  energy.  Our  newly  established  Ministry  of  Digital Transformation is leading these efforts to create a competitive digitally - driven economy that will stimulate greater opportunities for all of our people.         However, the misuse of digital technology can pose serious threats to the economy, national security, governance, and social stability. Therefore, we must develop appropriate mechanisms to protect and secure the integrity of our economies and societies and to minimize its use as a disruptive tool.   Mr. President, The thrust in all our efforts in pursuing sustainable development is to shape a better collective future on this planet, not only for ourselves, but for generations to come.   Trinidad and Tobago remains dedicated to ensuring  our  children  and  youth,  including  those  in  vulnerable  situations,  have  the  necessary  opportunities, tools and a safe environment in order to reach their highest potential.   Mr. President,  Evidence from the pandemic has shown that severe inequities continue to exist in our societies and that crises do not impact men and women in the same way. Therefore, in building back better, women’s participation in all sectors of society must be at the heart of creating more inclusive, resilient and sustainable communities and societies; with enhanced preparedness to respond to future emergencies. The promotion of gender equality is a priority for Trinidad and Tobago and so we have taken specific measures in certain key areas including access to health care, education and training, employment as well as in the provision of social protection. The important role of the family in the empowerment of women and girls has also been fully acknowledged.  Mr. President, This  year’s  High-Level  Meeting  on  the  Durban  Declaration  and  Programme  of  Action  takes  on  even greater significance with the recent establishment of the Permanent Forum on People of African Descent and the  convening  of  the  first  Africa-CARICOM  Summit  a  few  weeks  ago.  Africa  has  been  a  vibrant  partner  of CARICOM both bilaterally and in several multilateral arenas, including here at the United Nations.  In historical terms,  these  ties  have  been  umbilical,  but  with  the  joint  decision  for  regular  dialogue,  cooperation  and coordination, they will now be forward-looking as we seek to secure our broader interests in the international system.        The  lack  of  meaningful  progress  on  Security  Council  reform  remains  a  matter  of  deep  concern.  Our commitment  to  instill  new  life  into  the  intergovernmental  negotiations  should  amount  to  more  than  mere rhetoric. It should serve as a clarion call to Member States to work collaboratively, in good faith, toward early reform  of  the  Security  Council  to  effectively  respond  to  the  urgent  needs  and  challenges  facing  the  diverse membership  of  the  United  Nations.  A  representative  Council  will  add  substantially  to  improving  the effectiveness and credibility of our organization, as the leading international pillar for peace and security. Mr. President, As we have entered the Decade of Action and Delivery to implement the 2030 Agenda, it is important to ensure that no country is left behind. The unjust designation of Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism along with the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed against that country, undermine its ability to cope with the pervasive impacts of the pandemic and its potential to achieve sustainable development.  Accordingly, Trinidad and Tobago reiterates its call for the unconditional lifting of the embargo against Cuba, in line with the fundamental principles of the UN Charter. Trinidad and Tobago remains deeply concerned that so little progress has been made in the longstanding Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which has led to extreme suffering on both sides. We urge both parties to respect and adhere to the temporary ceasefire, and to do nothing that would inflame the already tenuous situation. It is our hope that the parties will shortly resume the process of engagement to find a way forward that would guarantee the Palestinians a permanent homeland and recognize Israel’s right to exist in peace and security.   Mr. President, The  United  Nations  provides  us  all  with  the  opportunity  to  discuss  our  differences,  to  build understanding and to make common cause in protecting our planet and our civilisation.  Let me reassure you of Trinidad and Tobago’s unshakeable resolve to support this effort as well as the work of the United Nations.   Mr President,  I THANK YOU.         "
37,2021,BLZ,Belize,"President, congratulations on being elected President of the General Assembly.  It is a great pleasure to see a representative of a fellow Small Island Developing State presiding over the 76th Session of the UN General Assembly. For a small island and low-lying coastal State like Belize, which three days ago celebrated forty years of political Independence, the world today is hostile and precarious.  No one can deny that the planet is getting hotter.  The facts are that July 2021 was the hottest month ever.  Each  of  the  last  four  decades  has  been  successively  warmer  than  any  decade  that  preceded  it since 1850.  Global temperature is now . degrees warmer. Sea levels are rising.  The  fact  is  that  global  average  sea  level  has  risen  faster  since  1900  than  over  any  preceding century in the last 3000 years.  Since 1900 droughts are unprecedented and have become more frequent and last longer. Severe weather events are more frequent and devastating.  The  last  twenty  years  have  seen  the  number  of  major  floods  more  than  double,  while  the incidence of storms grew from ,457 to ,034. Mother nature is rebelling.  She is reacting to our destructive tendencies, and our refusal to take urgent corrective action.  We can do better. And  now  Mr.  President,  our  capacity  to  survive  is  being  tested  by  the  unrelenting  COVID- pandemic.  COVID brought the Belizean economy to its knees.             Unemployment reached  percent as thousands of Belizeans lost their jobs.  GDP declined by  percent.  Our debt ballooned to 130 percent of GDP.  Many businesses were shuttered.  The poverty rate increased to  percent.  The impact of the pandemic has been swift, dramatic and devastating. The human toll has been deadly.  Already 399 Belizeans lost their lives to COVID-; we have a fatality rate of . percent.  Thousands have been hospitalized so far.  Our  health  facilities  are  overwhelmed  as  they  were  unprepared  for  the  surge  in  admission  of critical patients. This is not unique to Belize. To  confront  the  urgency  of  the  pandemic,  Governments  across  the  globe  reallocated  funds  to meet desperate needs.  Loans  originally  committed  for  development  and  climate  change,  were  diverted  to  cover emergency health needs and to mitigate the impact on the unemployed.  Massive additional borrowings became the new normal as lockdowns were extended.  The Common Framework and Debt Service Suspension Initiative failed to offer forbearance to ineligible  despite  our  debt including  Belize,  who  were most  middle-income  SIDS, unsustainability.  At the same time, most of our countries had no recourse to concessionary financing to fund the immediate health response.  El compromiso de Belice a la conservacin es ambicioso.  Reconocemos que nuestra dueda es insostenible y la vamos a ligar directamente a la conservacin.  Vamos a intercambiar millones de dlares en deuda para compromisos importantes en conservacin del mar.   Esperamos que  porciento de nuestra zona econmica exclusiva sera designada como area protegida antes del 2026; mucho antes del ao 2030.  Aun mas estableceremos un fondo para la conservacin maritima en perpetuidad.  En este rea orgullosamente estaremos en la vanguardia debido a nuestro amor a la naturaleza y respeto por el media ambiente. With  the  advent  of  the  vaccine,  Government  self-financed  its  acquisition  from  COVAX  and concurrently reached out to bilateral partners to solicit vaccine donations.        It was vaccines from our south south partners which allowed Government to roll out our national vaccination programme.  Mr President, the immediate global response was slow and inadequate to the scale and depth of the health crisis.  Disruption  of  supply  chains  made  access  to  the  much-needed  COVID-  therapeutics, diagnostics and PPEs beyond the reach of many developing countries.  Vaccine  hoarding  has  reduced  access  to  COVID-  vaccines  for  developing  countries, undermining COVAX and leading to deep and threatening inequalities.  Eighty percent of vaccines administered worldwide have been in high and upper middle income countries.  Only . percent of doses have been administered in low-income countries.  In Latin America and the Caribbean, the region worst hit by the pandemic, only about a fifth of the population has received vaccines.  A  pesar  de  las  inequidades  inmorales,  los  pases  que  tienen  un  grado  mas  alto  de vacunacion, estn a punto de administrar inyecciones de refuerzo a sus poblaciones que ya estn vacunados.  No solamente es injusto, simplemente es lamentable. Ciertamente el mundo necesita urgentemente volver a comprometerse al multi-lateralismo. Belize exists today because of the multilateral system.  The  support  of  UN  Member  States  for  Belize’s  territorial  integrity  and respect  for  our  right  to self-determination was critical to the achievement of Belize’s independence.  For us the multilateral system is indispensable. For  this  reason,  Belize  supports  the  Secretary  General’s  thoughtful  and  forward  looking  “Our Common Agenda,” which sets out a concise plan of action to accelerate the implementation of our agreed goals, including Agenda 2030.  Despite the inclination to retreat towards nationalist tendencies the truth is that whether it is the health  or  climate  crisis  —  the  scale  of  the  challenge,  the  magnitude  of  the  impact  and  the urgency of the action required, cannot be met by any one country alone.  Exclusion, inequality and vulnerabilities are also threats to the rich and strong. Therefore, our common future depends squarely on our solidarity, international cooperation and a strong and effective multilateral system.           We must commit to finding solutions, together, to the common problems that we confront.  Unbridled uni-lateral-ism must yield to a settled determination to respond to the major problems of our times with social justice.  My country is pursuing along with Guatemala, the final and peaceful resolution of Guatemala’s Claim to Belizean territory at the International Court of Justice.  In the meantime, the 2005 Agreement on Confidence Building Measures remains in effect, and our bilateral relations continue to be based on mutual goodwill.  We count on Guatemala to remain a constructive partner and rely on the international community to  support  us  in  addressing  the  daily  challenges  along  the  border  that  are  inevitable  between neighbours.  If the multilateral system is to be our collective lifeline, it must be re-purposed.  I wish to propose  areas for the reform and strengthening of the multilateral system: We  call  for  a  genuine  commitment  to  address  the  systemic  issues  which  undermine  the achievement of our agreed development goals.  The continued in-eli-gi-bility of SIDS from accessing concessional finance, leaves us in a vicious cycle of disaster or crisis recovery-borrowing leading to unsustainable levels of debt.  This must be disrupted.  A  multidimensional  vulnerability  index  is  the  indispensable  tool  for  restoring  rationality  to access affordable financing.  We,  therefore  welcome  the  work  of  the  UN  and  other  development  partners  such  as  the Commonwealth and the Caribbean Development Bank in developing an MVI that does not only consider economic development but also the inherent vulnerabilities of SIDS, scale, geography, and limited natural resources.  We need to adopt an MVI now.   We call upon all the international financial institutions and our development partners to use it.  There  is  no  alternative  if  our  countries  are  to  embark  on  a  sustainable  and  resilient  economic development path.  If our multilateral system is to remain credible it must have the capacity to induce action.  For far too long, too many global problems have been allowed to fester; and become crises.             The  entire  world  is  now  experiencing  the  consequences  of  our  inaction:  catastrophic  droughts, fires,  floods  and  more  frequent  and  intense  hurricanes  that  continue  to  affect  and  set  back  our small, open and dependent economies.  The  latest  scientific  assessment  of  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  lays  the blame firmly on human activity.  Belize, like other SIDS, is on the frontline of a climate crisis for which we are not responsible.  Belize incurs annual losses of close to  percent of GDP due to natural disasters.  Therefore,  we  felt  an  obligation  to  put  forward  an  ambitious  revised  Nationally  Determined Contribution.  Belize’s NDC covers new targets in both adaptation and mitigation.   It is naturally aligned to both our national development plans and the SDGs.  We have set some ambitious targets, including forest restoration and expansion of mangroves as well as achieving  percent of electricity from renewable sources by 2030.  The NDC also pledges to transition to a hybrid and electric public transportation system, increase resilience of coastal communities and strengthen the adaptive capacity of agriculture, health and tourism.  Belize  is  committed  to  developing  a  long-term  strategy  aligned  with  achieving  net  zero  global emissions by 2050.  We are doing our part.  We expect the developed countries and major emitters to do their part.  Indeed, ambitious commitments from the G- alone, can keep us on the path to limiting global temperature to . degrees Celcius.  COP    is  our  last  best  hope  to  limit  global  warming  to  .  degrees  Celsius  above  the  pre-industrial level.  We call for a ramping up of collective ambition so that by 2030 global emissions are reduced by  percent.  Developed countries and those in  a position  to  do so  must provide the  financial, technical and capacity building support to enable us to fulfill those pledges.  This includes meeting and exceeding the 100-billion-dollar pledge made in Copenhagen twelve years ago.  Additional  support  must  also  be  provided  for  the  loss  and  damage  being  incurred  through  the extreme and slow onset climatic events we are already experiencing.        Flexibility  and  responsiveness  are  critical  if  our  multilateral  system  is  to  have  relevance  at moments of crisis as well as to ensure equity and fairness in global responses.  COVAX, the multilateral mechanism for vaccine distribution has been unable to truly respond to the needs of its subscribers.  The  undermining  of  COVAX  through  export  bans,  vaccine  hoarding  and  predatory  purchasing has resulted in extreme inequality of access to vaccines.  Of the more than . billion vaccine doses that have been administered globally,  per cent have been given in just  countries.  COVAX has had to cut its forecast for distribution of vaccines by  percent for 2021.  Belize has no delivery date for its next COVAX shipment.  As  the  Director  General  of  the  WHO  said:  ""the  longer  vaccine  inequity  persists,  the  more  the virus  will  keep  circulating  and  changing,  the  longer  the  social  and  economic  disruption  will continue,  and  the  higher  the  chances  that  more  variants  will  emerge  that  render  vaccines  less effective."" The health and recovery of all of us, depend on the ability of our system to rapidly respond to the needs of all countries.  The multilateral system must be more effective in protecting the rights of all people.  Too many people remain marginalized and excluded, weakening the social contract, eroding trust in our multilateral system to deliver.  Mr President,  the persistent call of the General Assembly over three decades to end the illegal embargo against the Cuban people has been ignored.  The Cuban people are forced to carve out their sustainable development under the burden of the illegal, unilateral economic, commercial and financial embargo.  The new measures  imposed by the past  US administration and now continued and widened by the present one during a pandemic are unbelievably cruel and inhumane.  These measures bring suffering to millions of innocent people and do not reflect the good will of the people of the United States of America.  Nevertheless, Cuba has made significant sacrifices to help other peoples of the world, including Belizeans. Our Palestinian brothers and sisters continue to suffer under an oppressive apartheid and illegal Israeli occupation.          Belize fully supports the aspirations of the Palestinians for an independent state, within its 1967 borders, with  all attendant rights,  including the recognition of East Jerusalem as its capital and the right of return.  And  the  Sahawari  people  are  similarly  being  prevented  from  exercising  their  right  to  self-determination.  We urge the relevant parties and the international community to support them in their efforts. Belize  is  also  deeply  concerned  about  the  situation  of  Haiti  and  about  the  regional  and  global inaction to offer a genuine and substantive programme of support.  We  are  alarmed  at  the  inhumane  treatment  of  Haitian  refugees  who  are  risking  their  lives, traversing two continents for a better future.  We  therefore,  call  on  the  UN  to  galvanize  action  of  the  Member  States  and  its  development system to support the development of a Haitian led solution restoring its stability and security.  Our multilateral system must also be inclusive, harnessing the capacity of all States to scale up international cooperation where it is most needed.  Belize  has  benefited  greatly  from  our  diplomatic  partnership  with  Taiwan  that  is  based  on  the shared values of democracy, freedom, human rights and the rule of law.  Taiwan has provided tremendous assistance to Belize in terms of medical supplies and financial support,  so  Belize  is  better  equipped  in  combating  COVID-  and  conducting  post-  Pandemic recovery.  Belize  calls  for  Taiwan’s  inclusion  in  the  United  Nations  and  its  Specialized  Agencies,  which will  not  only  further  enhance  global  cooperation  and  partnership,  but  also  manifest  the  United Nation’s enshrined principle of universality.  Mr President, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen it is crystal clear that the confluence of crises facing  the  world  can  only  be  addressed  through  solidarity,  international  cooperation  and multilateral approaches. Let us not return to this great hall in September 2022 to lament further inaction.  Let us not return next year to again decry uni-lateral-ism, nationalism, and failed collective action.  No, Mr President, we must move forward together!  We can defeat COVID- but we can only do so together.  We must save the planet from the irreversible effects of climate change, but only if we act collectively and urgently.  Together, we can reform the world’s financial architecture to guarantee debt relief, make available affordable financing, and adopt a multidimensional vulnerability index.        Together, we must lift billions out of poverty and provide affordable housing, education and health care. Failure is not an option.  We believe in the power of humanity.  In the noble spirit of mankind.  We have confidence that we can, and we will make the world a better place.  The people of Belize, the citizens of the world expect nothing less. Thank you.     "

39,2021,BRA,Brazil,"President of the Federative Republic of Brazil, to the 76th General Assembly of the United Nations. - Mister President of the General Assembly, Abidulla Charrid, - Mister Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antnio Guterres,  - Heads of States and Government and other Heads of Delegation, Ladies and Gentlemen, - It is an honor to one more time open the General Assembly of the United Nations.  - I come here to show a Brazil that is different from the one portrayed on the newspapers or seen on television. Brazil has changed – a lot – since we have taken office in January of 2019.  - There has been not a single case of corruption in the past  years and  months.  - Brazil has a President  who  believes in God, respects its military, values family and is loyal to its people.  - It is a lot; it is a solid basis, if we consider that we were at the brink of socialism.  - Our state-owned enterprises which once incurred in billions of dollars in losses are now lucrative.    -  Our  National  Development  Bank  was  used  to  finance  projects  in communist countries, without any guarantees. It is the Brazilian people itself who honors these commitments.  - All of that has changed. I present to you now a new Brazil, a country that recovered its credibility.  - Brazil has the largest public-private partnership program of its history. A program that is a reality, and it is being fully implemented. - So far, 100 billion US dollars in new investments were contracted and  billion were collected in concessions.  -  In  the  infrastructure  sector,  we  have  auctioned    airports  and    port terminals to the private sector. - We have already more than  billion US dollars in private contracts for new railroads.  We  have  introduced  a  railway  permit  system,  which  brings  our model  closer  to  the  American  model.  In  just  a  few  days,  we  received   applications  for  permits  for  new  railroads,  which  accounts  for  almost   billion US dollars in private investment. -  In  our  government,  we  have  promoted  the  revitalization  of  the  railway system.  - As a result, there has been less fossil fuel consumption and the decrease of the operational costs associated with doing business in Brazil, especially in relation to food production. - Great progress has been made in the area of sanitation. The largest auction in this sector’s history took place in April, with the concession to the private sector of water distribution and sewage services in Rio de Janeiro. - We have everything that investors are looking for: a large consumer market, excellent  assets, a tradition of respecting contracts,  and  confidence in our government. - I also announce that in the next few days, we will hold the auction for the implementation of 5G technology in Brazil. -  Our  modern  and  sustainable  low-carbon  agriculture  feeds  more  than   billion  people  around  the  world  and  takes  up  only  %  of  the  national territory.  -  No other  country  in  the  world  has such  a  comprehensive  environmental legislation. Our Forest Code sets an example for other countries.  -  Brazil  is  a  country  of  continental  proportions,  with  great  environmental challenges.  It  has  .  million  square  kilometers,  of  which  %  are  still covered with the same native vegetation of the country’s discovery.  -  In  the  Amazon  biome  alone,  %  of  the  forest  is  intact,  harboring  the greatest  biodiversity  on  the  planet.  I  would  remind  you  that  the  Amazon region has an area equivalent to that of all Western Europe. -  We  anticipated,  from  2060  to  2050,  the  objective  of  reaching  climate neutrality.  Human  and  financial  resources  aimed  at  strengthening  the environmental  agencies  were  doubled,  with  a  view  to  eliminate  illegal deforestation. - And this important action is already beginning to bear fruits! - In the Amazon, deforestation was reduced by % in August in comparison with August of the previous year. - Which country in the world has an environmental preservation policy such as ours? - You are all invited to visit our Amazon! - Brazil is already an example in energy generation, with % coming from renewable sources. - At COP- we will seek consensus on the rules of the global carbon credit market. We expect industrialized  countries to effectively meet their climate financing commitments in significant amounts.  -  The  future  of  green  jobs  is  in  Brazil:  renewable  energy,  sustainable agriculture, low emission industry, sanitation, waste treatment and tourism. - We have ratified the Inter-American Convention Against Racism, Racial Discrimination and Related Forms of Intolerance. -  For  us,  the  traditional  family  is  the  foundation  of  civilization.  And  the freedom of the human being is only fulfilled by the freedom to worship. - % of our national territory, namely, over 110 million hectares, an area equivalent  to  Germany  and  France  combined,  is  destined  to  indigenous people reservations. In those regions, 600 thousand indigenous peoples live in freedom and share a growing wish to make use of their lands to agriculture and other activities. - Brazil has always participated in UN Peacekeeping Operations. From Suez to Congo, from Haiti to Lebanon. - Our country has always welcomed refugees. In our border with neighboring Venezuela,  the  “Operation  Welcome”,  by  the  Federal  Government,  has already  received  400  thousand  Venezuelans  displaced  by  the  severe economic and political crisis brought forth by the Bolivarian dictatorship. - The future of Afghanistan also gives us cause for deep apprehension. We will  grant  humanitarian  visas  to  Afghan  Christians,  women,  children  and judges. -  In  this  20th  year  since  the  terrorist  attacks  against  the  United  States  of America on September 11th 2001, I reiterate our condemnation of terrorism in all its forms. -  In  2022,  we  will  once  again  hold  a  seat  at  the  United  Nations  Security Council.  I  thank  all  the  181  countries,  out  of  190,  who  trusted  Brazil.  A reflection  of  the  serious,  responsible  foreign  policy  promoted  by  our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. -  We  support  a  reform  of  the  UN  Security  Council,  in  which  we  seek  a permanent seat. -  The  pandemic  caught  all  by  surprise  in  2020.  We  regret  every  death  in Brazil and in the world. - I have always supported the fight against the virus and unemployment, in a simultaneous manner and with equal responsibility. Isolation measures and lockdowns have left a legacy of inflation, particularly of food prices, all over the world. - In Brazil, in order to help those in need, forced to stay home by decisions from governors and mayors and who lost their source of income, we granted an emergency relief compensation of US$ 800 each for  million people in 2020. - I recall that we finished 2020, the year of the pandemic, with more formal jobs than those accounted for in December 2019 due to the actions of our government and programmes aimed at job and income support, which costed us around US$  billion.  - During the first  seven months of this year,  approximately   million 800 thousand new jobs were created. Our expected growth for 2021 is of %.  - Up to the present, the Federal Government has distributed more than 260 million  doses  of  the  vaccine  and  more  than  140  million  Brazilians, representing almost % of our adult population, have received at least the first dose. % of the indigenous population have also been fully vaccinated. By November, all those who wish to do so will be vaccinated in Brazil. -  We  support  vaccination,  however,  our  government  is  against  a  sanitary passport or any vaccine related obligation.  - Since the start of the pandemic we have supported doctor’s autonomy in search  of  an  early  treatment,  as  recommended  by  our  Federal  Council  of Medicine. I was among those who tried the early treatment. We also respect the doctor-patient relationship with regard to the medication to be used and its off-label utilization.  - We don’t understand why many countries, along with a large portion of the media, oppose early treatment.  -  History and Science will hold them accountable.  - On the last 7th of September, our Independence Day, millions of Brazilians, in  a  peaceful  and  patriotic  manner,  took  to  the  streets,  in  the  largest demonstration in our history, to proclaim that they will not forgo democracy and individual liberties and to show support for our government. - As demonstrated, Brazil is living in new times. In economic terms, we have one of the best performances among emerging countries.  - My government has restored Brazils external credibility and, today, it is one of the most promising destinations for investments.  - It is here, at this General Assembly, that we envisage a world with greater freedom, democracy, prosperity and peace.  God bless us all. "
40,2021,GUY,Guyana,"President of the Cooperative Republic of Guyana at the 76th Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations Mr. President I congratulate you on your election as President of the 76th Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.  Your election is a special honour for  the  Maldives  and  for  all  small-island  developing  and  low-lying  coastal States. I also wish to record Guyana’s appreciation to the outgoing President Volkan Bozkir who was tasked with navigating the Assembly during one of the most challenging years in modern history.  Mr. President Our world is a troubled place. The peoples of our planet are living under a cloud of uncertainty. COVID- has stomped across the globe, taking lives, wrecking livelihoods, and paralyzing economies. And,  looming  large  behind  it  is  Climate  Change,  growing  every  day  in  its capacity  to  inflict  even  greater  destruction  and  rumination  than  the coronavirus.            Our citizens look to us, the representatives of Nations, who gather here, to create conditions that will ease fear, erase doubt, and give hope. Yet, what they see are not nations united; they see nations divided. Secretary-General, Antnio Guterres, described our situation well when he said:  “The  pandemic  has  demonstrated  our  collective  failure  to  come together and make joint decisions for the common good, even in the face of an immediate, life-threatening global emergency”.   The pandemic has exposed the shortcomings of our international system. It has revealed that the system continues to be undergirded by nationalism which remains the prevailing force. After all these  years, since the founding of the United Nations, it is not the collective well-being of our one planet and our one humanity that motivates us; it is selfish national interests that drive us. And, in pursuit of that selfish nationalism, we overlook the truth of our shared cohabitation on one planet, one Earth, and we ignore the reality that what affects one, affects all. If nothing in the generations of civilization has taught us that nation states are  not  islands  onto  themselves  but  are  each  part  of  the  main,  then  the experience of the last two years should be a salutary lesson.          The world will not progress without greed, without war, and without freedom unless we, the leaders of nations – big and small – recall with commitment, the values set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and resolve to be faithful to them. Mr.  President,  the  pandemic  has  wrecked  Agenda  2030  for  Sustainable Development that the members of this Organization adopted in 2015. Development  gains  have  been  reversed,  poverty  has  expanded,  and inequality has widened. Widening  fiscal  deficits,  mounting  debt,  reduced  fiscal  space  and  external financial flows have imperiled the capacity of developing countries to attain the sustainable development goals. Within developing countries, the pandemic has upended growth, increased unemployment, and weakened health and education systems.  Education  regression  is  now  inevitable  given  the  long  period  our  children have  been  forced  out  of  the  formal  classroom  and  the  challenges  which many developing countries face in delivering virtual education. Given  these  problems,  economic  recovery  is  essential  to  returning developing countries to the path of attaining the SDGs.           But  such  recovery  will  be  painfully  elongated  and  slow  unless  there  is international  support  in  the  form  of  debt  rescheduling,  debt  service moratoriums, provision of soft resources to reboot economies. My government restates its call for increased resources to be made available to  States  on  the  basis  of  their  vulnerabilities  and  not  only  based  on  the misleading measure of per capita income. If  these  essential  measures  are  not  implemented,  growth  in  developing countries  will  not  be  restored  nor  will  economic  and  social  policies  be realigned along the path set out in Agenda 2030.  The  repercussions  will  be  felt  by  the  rich  nations  because  developing countries are markets for the goods and services of the industrialized nations and the source of their raw materials.   Poor  countries  cannot  buy  unless  they  have  the  means,  and  they  cannot produce unless they have the capacity. Our  world  will  become  a  damaged  place,  reversed  to  an  age  of  avarice, conflict and plunder. Surely, such a world – that now looms on the horizon – is one that all leaders should  work  to  avert,  and,  instead,  focus  their  attention  on  advancing  the progress of our one humanity in cooperation and mutual benefit. Surely, that is the world we all want.          Mr.  President,  while  poor  and  vulnerable  countries  will  suffer  longer,  and more intensely from the impact of the COVID- pandemic, rich countries have not been spared. Those,  who  at  the  advent  of  the  pandemic  concentrated  on  making themselves secure, now understand they will not be safe until we are all safe, because the virus knows not – and cares not – about race, ethnicity, age or gender. It will not heed borders or be stopped by walls. Belatedly, the rich have come to the realization that on our one Earth, they need the cooperation of the poor to save themselves. Mr President, we must all welcome that realization if it finally mobilizes the global cooperation and unified action that our world needs to survive. In  this  regard,  my  government  welcomes  the  Summit  on  COVID  that  was hosted by President Joe Biden.  We are pleased that it resulted, not only in commitments for joint global action, but also in the allocation of resources to achieve necessary and agreed objectives. Similarly,  we  welcome  the  fact  that,  earlier  this  month,  the  Heads  of  the International Monetary Fund, World Bank Group, World Health Organization and  World  Trade  Organization  met  with  the  CEOs  of  leading  vaccine manufacturing companies to discuss strategies to improve access to COVID-          vaccines,  especially  in  low  and  lower  middle-income  countries  and  in Africa. My government is pleased that the Heads of the International Organizations and  the  CEOs  of  the  major  pharmaceutical  companies  have  formed  a technical working group to exchange and coordinate information on vaccine production and deliveries. These  are  positive  developments  which  are  welcome,  even  though  they have come after millions have died and many more millions still live under the threat of death. The access to vaccines saw the world polarized.  I know, I speak on behalf of many leaders when I say that we must not now hurt our efforts at ending this polarization of access to vaccines by now implementing measures that divide us and curtail our movement based on the type of vaccines our people took.  Indeed, our efforts must be focused on full vaccination and addressing vaccine hesitancy.  Millions took the vaccines which were available at a time of much uncertainty, and they are the unsung heroes.  They must not now be the subject of restrictions based on the vaccine they took. Mr  President,  we  hold  out  similar  hope  that  the  world’s  worst  emitters  of greenhouse gases that are threatening the welfare of all mankind, will also come to the realization that in the end it will profit them little to emerge king over a world of dust. The promises of COP  in Paris have not been delivered.        If emissions follow the trajectory set by current national commitments, there is  a  less  than    per  cent  chance  of  keeping  temperatures  well  below  C relative to pre-industrial levels, and less than  per cent chance of reaching the .C Paris Agreement target. Large polluters have simply not kept their word and mistrust now pervades the air. That, Mr. President, is failure. It is also deception.  Recent authoritative research by the Royal Institute of International Affairs paints a grim picture of the future. It forecasts that cascading climate impacts can be expected to kill far more people  than  COVID-,  from  hunger,  intense  heat,  flooding,  and  more pandemics caused by the rise of pests and diseases.  It concluded that, combined with heatwaves and drought, these impacts will likely drive unprecedented crop failure, food insecurity and migration.  All this would drive political instability and greater national insecurity, and fuel regional and international conflict. Small island states and continental countries with low-lying coastlines, such as Guyana, would be the first to feel the full brunt of this impending disaster.              Yet,  our  countries  are  among  the  lowest  emitters  of  greenhouse  gas emissions,  contributing  the  least  to  the  harmful  and  destructive  effects  of Climate Change. This is not only unfair; it is unjust. Mr  President,  the  burden  of  reducing  emissions  is  not  being  carried equitably.  Small island developing and low-lying coastal states are punching above their weight in response to the global climate threats. My country, Guyana, is a net carbon sink. Our forests absorb far more carbon than is produced from human activity. But we have not folded our hands and sat back in satisfaction that we have done enough. We are continuing to contribute meaningfully to reducing global emissions and to decarbonizing the world’s economy, even though our country is now an oil and gas producer. Apart  from  containing  the  CO2  emissions  connected  to  the  industry,  we continue to pursue a path of developing energy from sustainable sources. In these circumstances, we feel we have the right to insist on a fair system of burden-sharing.            Innovative and creative ways have to be devised, Mr President, by which the world  must  act  to  avert  the  catastrophe  that  Climate  Change  so  plainly portends. COP26 in Glasgow in a few weeks’ time is the right and timely place to start. The worst emitters must make binding commitments in Glasgow to stop their profligacy. And  they  must  scale  up  their  contributions  to  help  small  and  vulnerable economies to build up resilience to the prolonged effects of damage that has already been done.  Failure to do so will shatter even more any confidence that the people of the world may still have that polluting nations will do the right thing. COP26 not COP15 could become the defining moment at which mankind’s future or fate is sealed. The peoples of the world will be watching. Mr  President,  Guyana  looks  towards  a  post-pandemic  era  that  will  reset international relations by curbing territorial avarice and embracing peaceful cooperation. In this regard, we draw attention to the continued overt threats to Guyana’s territorial integrity and sovereignty by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.             Just  recently,  an  agreement  was  issued  in  Mexico  City  by  which  the contending internal factions in Venezuela renewed a baseless claim to two-thirds of Guyana’s territory.  We have responded in clear terms. And I repeat our response now in these hallowed halls in which nations of the world meet in peace and cooperation. Guyana  cannot  be  used  as  an  altar  of  sacrifice  for  the  settlement  of Venezuela’s internal political differences.  While  my  government  welcomes  efforts  to  bring  about  domestic  harmony within Venezuela, agreements that defy international law and processes can be no basis for mediating such harmony. Guyana does not promote the use of violence or threats to settle disputes.  In a 1966 Agreement signed in Geneva, Venezuela consented to allow the UN  Secretary-General  to  decide  on  the  means  of  settlement  of  this controversy.  The Secretary-General decided on the International Court of Justice.  Both  Parties  are  therefore  bound  by  the  Court’s  jurisdiction  and  ultimate decision. Mr. President, we remain concerned about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.            Guyana restates its solidarity with the Palestinian people and their desire for a dignified existence in their own homeland in accordance with a two-state solution. The international community must act to meet the legitimate concerns of the Palestinians who have suffered for far too long. Mr.  President,  the strained  relations  between the United States  and Cuba are also a matter of deep concern to our region. We  are  convinced  that  normalization  of  relations  between  Cuba  and  the United States would have a beneficial impact on peace in the hemisphere and greater prosperity for all. Mr. President, I turn now to my own country – Guyana – a land of many ethnicities, drawn from its Amerindian people, people transported from Africa in the genocidal slave trade, people from India who were indentured to labour in a new land, people from Europe who migrated at a time of want and persecution, and people from China who were also brought to work on the plantations. They came with different religions; different cultures; and different perspectives. In the collective of their diversity, the people of Guyana are representative of the peoples of the world.          Whilst politically driven conflicts arise occasionally, and differences have been exploited for narrow political purposes, my government is convinced that the richness of our people’s diversity is a gift to our nation.  We continue to build a nation that draws on all aspects of its cultural roots to establish citizens who enjoy equal opportunity in all aspects of our society; a nation that is secure in itself and strong in its outlook. Our intention is to make Guyana an example for the world, utilizing the strength of our diversity for a single tapestry of One Nation, which is indivisible, strong, secure and prosperous. My government has set its foot firmly on the ladder to climb to that pinnacle of success. We are confident that as we foster peace and prosperity within our country, respect human rights, uphold democracy and the rule of law, and abide with our Constitution, we will achieve these noble goals. Mr. President, it is against this background of ambition for my country that my government embraces the vision set out in the Secretary-General’s report entitled, “Our Common Agenda”. We embrace his view that our nations must be driven by solidarity that he has  so  eloquently  described  as  “the  principle  of  working  together, recognizing  that  we  are  bound  to  each  other  and  that  no  community  or country, however powerful, can solve its challenges alone”.           Mr. President, “Our Common Agenda” provides the framework for the emergence of a post-COVID- era, which addresses the world’s fragilities, injustices, inequalities, conflicts, the eradication of poverty, banishment of racism and gender discrimination, and to realize ecological justice. Guyana looks forward to a revitalized United Nations spearheading the thrust towards a new era in international relations, in which the world emerges as a better, fairer, and stronger place for all mankind. I thank you.       "
41,2021,SUR,Suriname,"President of the Republic of Suriname on the occasion of the General Debate  of the  76th Session of the  United Nations General Assembly New York   September 2021 Please check against delivery                              THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF SURINAME | ADDRESS  On  the  occasion  of  the  General  Debate  of  the  76th  Session  of  the  United  Nations  General Assembly,  September 2021  Your Excellency Abdulla Shahid, President of the General Assembly, Your Excellency Antnio Guterres, Secretary General of the United Nations,  Excellencies,  Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. President, •  I  congratulate  you,  on  your  election,  to  preside  over  this  76th  session,  of  the  General Assembly.  •  I assure you, of my country’s full support, during your presidency •  I  take  this  opportunity,  to  acknowledge  His  Excellency  Volkan  Bozkir,  for  his  sterling leadership,  of  the  very  challenging  previous  session,  and  wish  him  well  in  his  future endeavors. •  The unpredictable turns, of the global political and economic landscape, demonstrate, that multilateral cooperation, international solidarity, and concrete action, are required more than ever. Indeed, Mr. President,  •  We  all  should  work  together,  to  deliver  for  the  People,  Planet,  Prosperity,  Peace  and Partnerships. •  All of these inter-connected challenges can be considered a puzzle, whereby the pieces can be found, in various countries.  •  I urge all of us, to work together, to solve this puzzle and secure the future of our planet. •  With  this,  we  will  demonstrate  leadership,  humanity  and  political  responsibility  and commitment. •  Now distinguished colleagues, is the time for solidarity, unity and global leadership! Page                         Mr. President,  •  The  COVID-  pandemic  has  clearly  highlighted,  that  when  in  crisis,  seemingly international solidarity, has little, or no meaning. •  Multilateralism and international solidarity came under pressure. •  It  has  unveiled  weaknesses  of  the  effectiveness  of  our  international  mechanisms,  and global legal infrastructure. •  Regretfully the  principle of  collective effort and  responsibility, was replaced by a more individual approach.  •  One to protect the nation first. •  However, I am taking this opportunity, to express my sincere gratitude, to the countries and organizations, who expressed solidarity, and had provided valuable support, to my country and people, in the battle against this pandemic, at a very early stage, our thanks extend especially to the Kingdom of the Netherlands, India, China and also the USA. •  Mr.  President,  the  exposed  weaknesses  of  our  health  systems,  must  be  addressed,  with innovative measures, with the use of modern technology and international cooperation. •  Allow  me,  as  we  go  forward,  to  underscore  the  importance  of  using  science  and technology, for peaceful purposes. We also need to pay attention, to the long-term social, and psychological aspects, the widening of the education gap, and the digital divide, as well as the unequal access to vaccines. •  Moreover, many countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, known as a middle-income region, regrettably, have not benefitted from the various COVID- multilateral debt relief solutions. •  Mr. President, we must develop a post COVID-strategy, with a focus on: o  Developing an effective strategy to improve vaccination levels in our societies. o  Rebuilding the economy; o  And establishing a COVID  recovery fund, with support of the international financial institutions and the private sector; •  We cannot go back, to what we were used to, but rather focus on: o  How we  organize  ourselves, for the “new normal”,  with COVID- as  part of our lives; o  Removing barriers, for ease of doing business and investments. Page                    Mr. President,  •  Beyond  the  severe  impact  of  COVID-,  we  have  been  challenged,  with  financial  and economic deficiencies, including a high debt burden. •  In this regard, access to concessional financing, is of critical importance, in rebooting our economy. •  Currently, we face unrealistic, unfair, and counterproductive classification instruments. •  Suriname  looks  forward  to  new  substantive  methods  of  financial  support,  based  on  the socio-economic reality, of the countries concerned. •   At the same time, the vulnerabilities of countries, should be taken into account. •  I call on all, to support the multi-dimensional vulnerability index, as proposed by SIDS (Small Island Developing States) and remove bureaucracy in supporting these states.  •  It is, in the interest of all of us! Mr. President,  •  Suriname supports the call for a stronger and more effective United Nations. •  A restructured and revitalized United Nations must ensure, that the organization, remains the source of redress, for the international community, and home, to international justice and equitable decision-making. •  It  is  my  firm  believe,  societies  should  be  organized  based  on  democratic  values,  good governance, an independent judiciary, and with respect for human rights. •  In  achieving  these  objectives,  we  must  allow  countries,  especially  in  the  midst  of  the COVID- crisis, to develop sustainable economies, without obstacles. •  Isolation and trade blockades, such as, in the case of Cuba, in my own region, undermine these principles and are counterproductive, to achieving these goals. •  Therefore, I am calling for continued dialogue and negotiations, to solve differences and conflicts, within the framework of the charter of the United Nations. Page                    Mr. President,  •  Climate change remains a serious challenge and an existential threat, which requires the attention of all us. •  In  recent  months,  we  have  witnessed  its  worldwide  impact,  such  as  deadly  floods, widespread forest fires and significant rises in global temperature. •  No country or region was spared of its wrath! •  In the case of my country, Suriname, and the countries, with low-lying coastal areas, we are  committed, to fighting  climate change, because we  are  particularly  vulnerable,  even though, we have contributed, the least, to this problem. •  Suriname is a High Forest, Low Deforestation country, with a forest coverage of approx. %. •  Suriname significantly contributes, to the mitigation of the effects of climate change.  •  We are one, of the few carbons negative rating countries, in the world. •  Yet, we are not fully benefitting, from global arrangements, associated with sound forest management. •  The time has come, to acknowledge the unique challenges, faced by the high forest, low deforestation  developing  countries,  and  to  improve  and  maximize,  their  fair  access  to climate finance. •  As we prepare for COP , in early November this year, in Glasgow, we must bear in mind, that noble ideals, with strong political commitments, do not mean much, if not supported, with new financial resources. •  COP , therefore, should result in ambitious and actionable commitments. •  Suriname calls on developed countries, to recommit to the 100 billion US dollars per year, to support developing countries, as agreed in the 2015 Paris Agreement. •  In  this  regard,  I  stress  the  importance  of  the  Amazon  Cooperation  Treaty  Organization (ACTO) and the need, to support its activities, aimed at protecting the Amazon rainforest and its biodiversity. Page                      Mr. President,  •  One year ago, the new government of Suriname, under my leadership, took office, and had to deal with several financial and economic challenges. •  Amidst the climate change challenges, and the COVID- pandemic, my country is also confronted  with  a  challenging  fiscal  choice,  between  servicing,  an  increased  sovereign debt, or to spend more in health, education, and the livelihoods of our citizens. •  In order, to get the tremendous foreign debt under control and make our economy healthy again, my country had decided, to develop a comprehensive recovery plan, which at staff level, has been approved by the IMF, and we look forward to Board Level approval as soon as possible. •  Suriname,  is  also  at  the  cusp,  of  attracting  substantial  foreign  direct  investments, particularly in the extractive industry, agriculture and tourism. •  For this purpose, the enabling environment, is being prepared, including the development of a local content policy and a new investment code, to facilitate these investments. •  Therefore, I am inviting the international business community, to invest in my beautiful country and contribute, to sustainable development and the earmarked transition towards a green economy. In closing Mr. President,  •  I stand here, at the stronghold of multilateralism and international solidarity, and call on all of us, to play our part in moving our words into action. •  We  need  a  new  more  agile,  equitable  and  effective  multilateralism,  based  on  the  new realities, the world is facing today.  •  One that is efficient, with collective leadership, a solution-oriented approach, and serving the needs of all countries. Mr. President,  Distinguished leaders,  •  It is our obligation, as leaders of today, to build a better world and planet, for those living today, but more so, for those generations still to come. I thank you.  May God bless you. *** Page                  "
42,2021,CAN,Canada,"President of the General Assembly, Excellencies,   Before I begin, please allow me a personal observation.    As I address you, I am conscious that I am speaking to virtually the entire world.    In my previous career, I was an astronaut and I had the opportunity to see the entire world from the vantage point of space.    I have flown over all of your countries and I have reflected a great deal on our planet, Earth.             I have realized that Earth is the cradle of all humanity and that we all come from the same place and that we have nowhere else to go. o  – and that we must find a way to get along with each other.  o  – and that we must take care of our planet- a planet that we are visibly damaging.    Space offers the unique perspective of seeing beyond one’s own national borders.    In that sense, this body, the United Nations, offers that same perspective.   I am honoured to be here with you today on behalf of Canada’s newly re-elected Government, led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.   I would like to begin my address by respectfully acknowledging that the land on which we gather today is the traditional unceded territory of the Lenape (Le-NOP-ay) people.    Fellow delegates, friends – we are assembled today at one of the most challenging times in generations.   The world is facing simultaneous and cascading crises, including climate change, the COVID- pandemic, and threats to international peace and security, which serve to exacerbate inequalities, test our resilience and shine a bright light on the shortcomings of our systems and institutions.   But not for the first time has this institution faced such formidable challenges. We must not be querulous or faint-hearted in the face of the hardships and difficulties of our modern world.  That is not why we are here.     We must learn from the vision and courage of those who have gone before, and we must think of the hopes and aspirations of those who will inherit the world we leave behind.             From the ashes of World War , our parents and grandparents responded to the unprecedented social and economic collapse of the 1930’s and ’s with its accompanying death and destruction, by building a new international order based on rules and strong international institutions to bring stability, prosperity and peace for the generations that would follow.  They did not wring their hands in despair.  They rolled up their sleeves and went to work.     Climate change, COVID-, the rise of authoritarianism and inequality – these are the challenges of our time. They are ours to solve and overcome.    In doing so, we must look toward the future with optimism. Just as our parents and grandparents stepped up to the challenges of their moment, so too must we recognize and seize our own opportunity to shape the future. Climate Change   [Mr.] President, there is no more perfect example of where multilateral solutions and political will are needed than in addressing the impact of climate change.   Like all of you in this great hall, Canada is not immune to the climate crisis.  Earlier this year, the west coast of Canada faced a record-setting heatwave – in some places reaching over  degrees Celsius – which saw hundreds of people lose their lives, and an entire town in the province of British Columbia destroyed.    This is our new reality.    We know that the world expects leadership from the United Nations.     When we attend COP- this fall, young people around the world will be looking to us to increase our ambition and strengthen global cooperation.    We cannot let them down. It is in our hands.             In Canada, you have a steadfast and dedicated partner.    We are doing our part at home – including putting a price on carbon that will rise to $170 per tonne by 2030, and increasing our emissions reductions targets – and also internationally, including recently doubling our climate finance contribution to $. billion over the next five years.   [Mr. President,] over successive generations, we have worked together to help multilateralism evolve to meet our needs. To expand to new areas, and refine old approaches.    Together, we harnessed hope, confronted fear, and innovated to try to improve lives the world over.   It was messy, it was hard, and it was often slow. But more often than not, obstacles were overcome by a combination of global ingenuity and political will.     That same capacity for human ingenuity is still there. It is this collective political will that we must re-ignite.  It is in our hands.    There are those who stand at this podium and argue that national sovereignty is the sole bedrock of international relations, and that this is the essential purpose of the Charter.     In response, I would say that challenges like climate change are a compelling reminder as to why a multilateral response remains necessary.     Put simply: governments acting alone cannot overcome the problems facing our world. Our founders knew that.  They said it, and they proved it right by their deeds.   Rising Inequalities   The cost of turning inward will be catastrophic for people around the world, and only lead to rising inequality.              Last year, as all of our governments focused on our domestic response to COVID-, we moved backwards on meeting some of our sustainable development goals.  Extreme poverty spiked for the first time in three decades.   The pandemic forced us to take stock of growing inequalities within our own societies, with seniors, racialized people, women, the LGBTQ2+ community and Indigenous peoples bearing the worst of the economic slowdown. The pandemic also fanned racism, antisemitism and Islamophobia, and exacerbated inequalities between countries, with the richest among us having speedy access to vaccines, while citizens in poorer countries struggle for their health and well-being.   We know what must be done.  We just need to choose to do it. It is in our hands.   In the immediate term, as the pandemic continues to rage in most parts of the world, we must focus on scaling up production and equitable distribution of vaccines, and on the economic reality facing least developed and middle-income countries, such as rising debt levels and liquidity challenges.    Addressing these inequalities and fostering a more robust spirit of global solidarity in the face of these daunting challenges reflects not only Canada’s values and interests, but also the values and interests of the United Nations. It is in our hands. Authoritarianism    We know that isolationism also contributes to growing authoritarianism.    In the face of the COVID crisis, some have seized opportunities to erode civil liberties, freedom of expression and other universal human rights.   Yet, we do not need to look far back in history to know that politics based on lies, deception, exclusion and inequality creates hardship and pain for people around the world.  The spread of systematic misinformation and         propaganda on social media and through the internet has made us realize that the digital revolution comes with risks and dangers we cannot ignore.     Canada will continue to stand firm against the forces of lying and fear, of oppression and hate, of criminality and corruption.  For this is fundamentally who we are as Canadians.   Our commitment to human rights and the rule of law extends well beyond our shores. Canada will continue its work to promote respect for the rights of people everywhere.   For example, we will continue to press for democracy and the rule of law in Myanmar, where the overthrow of the elected government by the Tatmadaw has caused much hardship and suffering to the Myanmari people, and we support all efforts to end the military dictatorship and assure the rights of all peoples of Myanmar, including the Rohingya, whose lives are threatened by a genocidal regime.     Canada will continue to lead efforts to maintain judicial independence, media freedoms, and the rule of law. We must all continue to fight against impunity.   I stand before you to say this is not something we simply talk about.  It is something we do.  Two days ago, we welcomed back to Canada Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, who were imprisoned by the Chinese government after Canada applied both Canadian and international law in response to a request for extradition of a Chinese citizen.     Canada observed the rule of law, and two Canadian citizens paid a heavy price for this commitment.  We did so as a matter of principle, and we are proud of the courage of our two citizens, the good faith and resilience of their families, and the determination and creativity of our diplomats. We continue to oppose the way these two fine people were treated.             And on that I want to recognize the support of our many international partners in standing with these Canadian citizens, as well as those who helped in developing and signing the Declaration on Arbitrary Detention in state-to-state relations.   Our solidarity in defence of human rights and international law is an important signal. We must continue to stand together, united in our shared determination to defend our values and principles.   There is a reason respect for human rights is one of the three pillars of the United Nations.  Canada will never forget this experience and this lesson.  We shall continue to press for an end to arbitrary detention, wherever and however it occurs.   Peace & Security    The institutions and rules that we have established over the -year history of the United Nations have underpinned decades of world peace and growing prosperity.     There have been no world wars. Extreme poverty has been significantly reduced.    But the benefits of multilateralism were not always distributed broadly, evenly or fairly. And the potential for peace remains unrealized in far too many places.   For the truth is that every region of the world is affected by a lack of peace – whether in the Americas, the Middle-East, Africa, Ukraine, Haiti, the Sahel or Afghanistan – and we far too often lack the political will necessary to build peace.     I had the opportunity to visit the Middle East earlier this summer, and listened carefully to Israeli and Palestinian leaders as well as representatives of civil society.               Canada is deeply committed to Israel’s right as a member of the United Nations to live in peace and security.  We also believe that a two state solution is the better way to address the needs and concerns of both Israelis and Palestinians, and we encourage direct negotiations to reach this critical objective.     Conflict, no matter its geography or cause, is not simply an issue of national sovereignty.  Insecurity somewhere invariably leads to insecurity elsewhere and we all pay the price.     Effective responses to these issues are also in our hands. Refugee & Humanitarian Crises   We know that climate change, food insecurity and conflict will continue to exacerbate the challenge of forced migration and humanitarian need in the years to come.    Make no mistake: this will affect all of us, and requires that we address these issues together.   The numbers of refugees and other forcibly displaced people are already hitting record highs year after year. We must listen to their voices and give them a place at the table.   Humanitarian assistance must keep pace, but should not be viewed as a substitute for addressing the root causes of the problems forcing people to flee in the first place.    For our part, through dedicated asylum policies, Canada will also provide refuge for those who put themselves at personal risk by defending democracy and upholding human rights.    Canadians are a welcoming people. When we saw the tragedy befalling the Syrian people, Canadians opened their hearts and their homes, bonding together to personally help people rebuild their lives. Where some see risk, we see opportunity.             In just a few short years, in communities across Canada, Syrians have built businesses, raised their children and become part of the fabric of our country – just as many other communities did before them.   This is Canada’s competitive advantage. We welcome people in need, but also understand that their hard work, talents and cultures enrich us all. Many come to Canada to flee, and find a place in which they can not only build a new life, but from which to build a better world.    Now, faced with a heart wrenching situation in Afghanistan Canadians have once again shown their openness to those who do not wish to live under Taliban rule but prefer to stand up for democracy, human rights and gender equality.    In fact, Canadians overwhelmingly called on us to do more. And in response to their generosity and welcoming spirit we have now committed to welcoming ,000 Afghan refugees to Canada – so that they too can contribute to our success, while we continue to support their efforts for a more peaceful, tolerant world. Gender Equality & Indigenous Rights   [Mr.] President, our participation in the United Nations comes with a commitment to freedom, truth, and the rule of law.    We also have the responsibility to speak for those who have been marginalized, discriminated against, or shunned.    We are proud of Canada’s achievements toward achieving gender equality – both domestically and internationally.  But we are not complacent.    We will continue our focus on these issues at home – including removing barriers that prevent women from fully participating in the workforce and our economy, such as working to provide access to affordable, $ a day childcare for every young family in Canada.             A recovery that does not promote the full participation of women in the economy will not be fully successful.   And we will continue our focus on these issues internationally –through improving girls’ education, reducing early and forced marriage, and through our significant support to local feminist movements around the world.   We also have the responsibility to hold each other and ourselves to account.   The rights of Indigenous Peoples have been an area of profound national reflection in Canada due to greater awareness of past failures and persistent challenges faced by First Nations, Inuit and Metis Peoples.   We are committed to continuing on the path to reconciliation and know the eyes of the world are on us.   Earlier this year, we adopted the National day for truth and reconciliation and we made the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People the law of the land.   Prime Minister Trudeau has committed to mandating each member of his Cabinet with implementing it.  We also committed to support systemic change to address the tragedy of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.   By doing so, we are fully recognizing the hardship that racist colonial policies have inflicted on successive generations of Indigenous people.    The Government of Canada remains fully committed to protecting the rights of Indigenous Peoples and improving their living standards.               The future is in our hands   Colleagues, friends, I am optimistic.   We have heard over this past week of the urgent and confounding problems that we face as a global community. We know there is a digital divide, that millions of children have been locked down and locked out of schooling, that pluralism faces a struggle against the forces of extremism and even terrorism, that many are bewildered in the face of new technologies that can invade our privacy, uproot our families, and change the face of work.     But we have the solutions and tools at our disposal.  If we listen to each other and bring these critical issues to the centre of our work together, we can make progress.  It is in our hands.     We have a United Nations that, over this past year, has proven that it is up to the operational challenge of delivering in the most difficult of situations.   We have a menu of bold ideas and proven solutions. And here I would like to thank the Secretary-General for putting forward his Common Agenda, which we must all consider seriously.    We know what must be done. We must marshall the political will to do it.   This will require a shift in mindset. It is no secret that we spend too much time talking and not enough time making decisions.      Our parents and grandparents rose to the challenge in 1945. Now it’s our turn to work together to set the course for a fairer, more just and sustainable future for all.                 It is in our hands.  My most distinguished predecessor as Foreign Minister, Nobel Prize winner Lester Pearson, put it this way: “The fact is that to every challenge given by the threat of death and destruction, there has always been the response from free people: It shall not be.  By these responses we have not only saved ourselves, but have insured our future”.     In this noble effort, you can count on Canada today and in the days, months, and years ahead.     Thank you.    "
43,2021,KAZ,Kazakhstan,"President of the Republic of KAZAKHSTAN  at the General Debate of the 76th session of the UNGA  “Building resilience through hope – to recover from COVID-,  rebuild sustainability, respond to the needs of the planet,  respect the rights of people, and revitalize the United Nations” (September 2021, New York) Dear Mr. President, Dear Mr. Secretary General, Ladies and gentlemen, I  congratulate  you,  Мr.  President,  оn assuming  the  Presidency  of  the  seventy-sixth session.  I  will  focus  today  first  and  foremost  on  the triple  threat  we  face  together:  COVID- the recovery; humanitarian situation in Afghanistan.   the  Climate  crisis;  and In  the  last  year,  the  COVID-  pandemic has  exploded  from    million  to  225  million confirmed cases.   We  are  deeply  grateful  to  all  health workers, scientists and vaccine makers who    produced  in  a  remarkably  short  time  safe  and effective vaccines. the But and very economic social difficult.  remain repercussions Unemployment has risen sharply and hundreds of millions of people are losing their livelihoods. More than 130 million people are now living in extreme  poverty.    Decades  of  development progress are being lost.  In  many  ways,  the pandemic  has  exposed our  vulnerability  and  underscored  the  critical importance  of  multilateralism  and  international solidarity.  We  must  “build  back”  a  more equitable, sustainable, and humane world. We  must  begin  with  universal  and  fair access  to  vaccines.  This  matter  must  be resolved as a matter of global ethics and solidarity.  The unjust “vaccine gap” is a “gap multiplier”.   The  IMF  notes  that  the  global  economic recovery is not “global” because of the widening gap between advanced “vaccinated” economies and  emerging  or  developing  “unvaccinated”   ones.  The  net  effect  will  be  to  wipe  out  $. trillion of cumulative global GDP by 2025.   We  must  exponentially  and  urgently increase global access to vaccines. Kazakhstan has  successfully  produced  its  own  QazVac vaccine.  Two  more in development.  We  stand  ready  to  share  them bilaterally or under the COVAX facility. vaccines  are The World Trade Organization is critical to ensuring  supply  chains  for  essential  medical goods  and  equitable  vaccine  access.  As  the Chair of the 12th WTO Ministerial Conference this  November,  Kazakhstan  calls  on  WTO Members  to  deliver  a  meaningful  outcome  on WTO’s response to the COVID- pandemic. We  also  need  more  focused  cooperation between governments and the pharmaceutical industry  on  licenses,  technology  transfers and technical support. In the meantime, economic recovery is subject to  many  other  “known  unknowns”,  including technology tensions. An “economic iron curtain”   scenario, in which different technologies and rules split the global economy, is becoming more likely.  Such  a  scenario  would  severely  constrain those  states  who  want  to  trade  globally  and secure  tech-related  supplies.  Eager  to  avoid taking  sides,  they  could  be  forced  to  form  a “Technological  Non-Alignment  Movement” intersection  of the to  mitigate technologies and geopolitics.  risks  at *** Ladies and gentlemen, Carbon  dioxide  levels  are  at  record  highs. Wildfires,  cyclones,  floods  and  droughts  have the  new  normal,  devastating become populations  and  causing  much  preventable human suffering. As a large landlocked country, Kazakhstan’s climate is warming faster than the global average and threatening our population and economy. The  median  annual temperature  has increased  C  in  the  last    years  with    serious droughts now striking twice every five years.  In response, Kazakhstan intends to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. We are launching a  national  2050  low  carbon  development strategy  next  month  to  reduce  GDP  energy intensity by % from 2008 levels. Since  almost  %  of  Kazakhstan's electricity  generation  depends  on  coal,  the energy transition present significant challenges.   Access  to  green  financing  and  green technologies  will  be  critical  to  this  transition, the  upcoming  COP26 and  we conference in Glasgow for clear commitment on  these  issues.  Without  ambitious  green financing, ambitious climate action is empty.   look to We  also  give  great  importance  to  the COP15  of  the  Convention  on  Biological Diversity in Kunming in October 2021. ***    Turning  to  Afghanistan,  we  endorse  the UN Security Council’s call for the establishment, through negotiations, of a new Government that is inclusive and representative. A consensus-based system must be put in place  where  groups  of  different  values,  or ethnic,  religious  and  gender  background can coexist in the same country. In general, Kazakhstan envisions Afghanistan  as  a  truly  independent,  sovereign nation  living  at  peace  with  itself  and  its to neighbors.  Afghanistan  must  continue adhere  to  its  international  obligations  and ensure  its  territory  is  free of  terrorists,  drugs, and human traffickers. Whatever our political affiliations or personal feelings, we must not abandon the people of Afghanistan now.       The  acute  humanitarian  situation  should be  our  first  priority.  UN  agencies  and  other humanitarian actors must have immediate, safe and unhindered humanitarian access. Kazakhstan  has  provided  a temporary relocation  for  UNAMA  and  other  UN  offices for  Afghanistan.  We  are  ready  to  provide  a logistical  platform  for  humanitarian  aid  into Afghanistan,  as  well  as  to  contribute  our  fair share.  The  Kazakh  initiative  to  establish  a  UN Regional hub in Almaty can serve this crucial mission. We are ready to work closely with the UN,  regional  neighbors  and  interested  states and organizations. The  future  stability  of  Afghanistan  depends on  economic  development.  Afghanistan  is not a threat but an opportunity.  If unified and stable,  it  can  contribute  to  Central  Asia’s development.     *** Excellencies, I turn to several other important UN issues, including the need to revitalize disarmament. Last  month,  on  August,  we  marked  the 30th  anniversary  of  the  decision  to  close  the Semipalatinsk  nuclear  test  site  and  relinquish the fourth largest nuclear arsenal in the world.  Kazakhstan  again  urges the  nuclear-weapon  States  to  commit  themselves  to  the complete elimination of nuclear weapons by 2045, the Centennial of the United Nations. existential biological Similarly,  there  is  more  work  to  be  done threats.  against I proposed last year an  International Agency for  Biological  Safety.    This  is  a  bold  and ambitious idea, but we believe it is timely. Open and  transparent  dialogue  with  all  stakeholders is ongoing.   ***    Implementation  of  the  2030  Agenda  and SDGs has suffered a considerable setback.  Least  Developed  countries,  Landlocked Island Developing  Countries  and  Small Developing States – some  countries in total –  are  disproportionately  affected  by the pandemic given their limited means to respond to shocks and vulnerability to a debt crisis.  As  the  Global  Chair  of  the  LLDCs, Kazakhstan appeals to all UN agencies to work together  to  deliver  on  the  2024  Roadmap  for Accelerated the  Vienna Implementation  of Program of Action.  The  2030  Agenda  will  remain  unattainable until all countries have the financial capacity to invest  in  a  sustainable  and  inclusive  future.  In regard,  we  specifically  call  on  all this development  partners jointly  address to international liquidity and debt vulnerabilities.  ***   The World Food Program estimates that 270 million people will face food shortages this year.  Kazakhstan is a major grain producer and exporter  and  a  founding  member  of  the Islamic  Organization  for  Food  Security, whose  fourth  General  Assembly  was  held  last month in our capital.   We  invite  foreign  investors  to  join  us  in shaping a better, brighter future for sustainable agriculture. *** Sustainable development depends not only on  economic  growth,  but  also  on  social  and political development.  At    years  old,  Kazakhstan  is  already  a mature and accomplished nation. Over the last few  years,  we  have  started  shifting  from  top-down nation-building – which proved extremely efficient during early statehood – to more bottom-up democracy-nurturing. We aim to consolidate our  democratic  commitment  and  promote  wider citizen engagement in governance.   For  example,  we  have  introduced  direct election of rural mayors for the first time. This will  place  far  more  power  and  control  in  the hands  of  more  than  %  of  Kazakh  citizens. We will do the same for district mayors in 2024. In  line  with  the  concept  of  a  state  that listens  and  responds  to  its  citizens,  since 2019,  my  Administration  has  launched  four blocks  of  essential  democratic  reforms  to strengthen  human  rights,  the  rule  of  law,  and anti-corruption.    For  example,  I  recently  proposed  applying the recent  percent quota for women and youth  in  electoral  party  lists  to  the  final parliamentary composition.   There  is  no  room  for  complacency.  Our goal  is  to  further  improve  the  efficiency  of  the state, transparency, and competitiveness of the political process. Political reforms will have a dynamic follow-up.      In  January of  this  year, Kazakhstan  ratified the the  Second  Optional  Protocol International  Covenant  on  Civil  and  Political Rights, abolishing the death penalty. to In  June, the  Government  approved  a Comprehensive  Plan  for  Human  Rights long-term Protection, institutional framework. laying down a In  close  collaboration  with  our  international partners,  we  are  working  hard  to  eliminate requires human extraordinary global cooperation. trafficking, which We are a candidate for membership on the UN Human Rights Council for 2022 -2024.  If elected,  Kazakhstan  will  strive  to  make  a  real contribution to the Council. We also aim to advance the “democracy – religion – development  nexus”  during  the seventh  Congress  of  Leaders  of  World  and Traditional Religions next April in Kazakhstan.     *** Turning to Central Asia, despite challenges to stability  and  security,  we  see  a  gradual strengthening  of  political  and  economic informal cooperation.  Three  Central  Asian summits  –  the  latest  one  held  last  month  –  are leading to a more cooperative and resilient region. Our regional policy aims to gradually replace the  zero-sum  politics  and  “might  makes right”  of  the  “Great  Game”  with  genuine cooperation and a people-centered Great Gain in the Heart of Asia.  This creates opportunities for greater global community engagement with Kazakhstan and Central  Asia.  We  place  great  hope  in  the regional  “C5+”  dialogue  frameworks  with major extra-regional actors.   In such partnerships, we emphasize Central Asia’s  water-related  challenges, including water scarcity, degrading quality and inefficient use.  Our  region’s  water  security  is  inextricably linked with energy, food and environment.   Despite  the  diverging  interests  of  riparian states,  Kazakhstan  remains  committed  to  a regional water-and-hydropower consortium to coordinate different policies towards mutual goals.  *** Mr. President, Ladies and gentlemen, Situated  at  the  Eurasian  crossroad  of civilizations, Kazakhstan remains committed to its  well-balanced,  constructive foreign policy.

44,2021,TJK,Tajikistan,"President of the Republic of Tajikistan H.E. Mr. Emomali Rahmon       at the General Debates of the  t h Session of the United Nations                                General Assembly        (Video-Message,  September 2021) New York, September , 2021                                                                    Please check against delivery Distinguished Mr. Chairman, Excellency Secretary-General, Ladies and gentlemen, At the outset, I would like to convey my congratulations to the Chairman of this session of the UN General Assembly, Mr. Abdullah Shahid, on his election to this post. Dear colleagues, On September , the glorious people of Tajikistan celebrated a very historic and memorable event - the 30th anniversary of Tajikistan’s state independence. In the initial years of our independence, our country was plunged into the tragic events of the imposed civil war, and went through difficult days. Ending  the  war,  bringing  the  fighting  parties  together,  ensuring  peace  and stability, and concurrently restoring diplomatic relations and constructive cooperation with the countries of the world were among our top priorities. Despite the existing difficulties, thanks to the policy of ""open doors"" and peace, we  have  managed  to  take  a  deserved  position  on  the  world  stage  and  ensure  the sustainable development of our country. Dear colleagues, The  already  unstable  situation  in  the  current  world  is  further  complicated  by geopolitical and geoeconomic competition and the growing level of threats and dangers, as well as the unprecedented spread of infectious diseases. This  situation  doubles  the  responsibility  of  states  to  pursue  a  far-sighted  and coordinated policy to address the current challenges. The role of international and regional organizations, especially the United Nations and its specialized agencies, is key to finding effective solutions to the problems of the current world. Recent developments in Afghanistan, linked to the political and humanitarian crisis and governance, pose a serious threat to regional security and stability. Mr Chairman,            The crisis situation in Afghanistan, which shares almost ,400 km of border with Tajikistan, cannot leave the Government and the people of our country indifferent. The rise to power of the Taliban, which is listed as a terrorist group by the United Nations  Security  Council,  has  further  complicated  the  region's  already  complex geopolitical process. The Taliban's failure to deliver on its earlier promises to form a comprehensive government with the broad participation of Afghan political and ethnic forces is a matter of serious concern. Tajikistan  strongly  condemns  all  forms  of  lawlessness,  murder,  looting  and oppression against the people of Afghanistan. Unfortunately, human rights organizations have remained silent on the violation of the rights of other ethnic groups residing in Afghanistan and the freedoms of its citizens, especially women and children, and have not commented on the matter. As  in  the  case  of  Panjshir  Province  in  Afghanistan,  we  are  witnessing  a  tragic violation of international human rights. The people of Panjshir have no access to food, other basic commodities, as well as humanitarian aid, and even the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross are still unable to enter Panjshir to fulfill their humanitarian obligations. The current situation is a humanitarian catastrophe. The growing intensity of fights between the ethnic groups and tribes in Afghanistan is  another  factor  further  destabilizing  the  political  and  security  situation  in  our neighboring country. In  view  of  this,  the  establishment  of  a  comprehensive  dialogue  with  the participation of all segments of Afghan society is one of the main preconditions for the establishment of lasting peace and stability in that country. In  this  regard,  along  with  other  ethnic  groups  of  this  country,  the  Tajiks  of Afghanistan, who comprise more than % of the population of this country, have the right to take their deserved pie in the public affairs. Mr Chairman, We will not interfere in the internal affairs of Afghanistan. However, we  believe  that  in order to  properly  address the political  and  security problems  of  the  neighboring  country,  it  is  necessary  to  form  a  comprehensive government through elections based on the will of the people of this country with the engagement of all political groups and national and ethnic minorities. Thus, in our view, it is necessary to determine the structure of government in that country through a referendum by taking into account the position of all citizens of the country. The formation of any government without taking into account the interests of all the people of Afghanistan can lead to catastrophic consequences in this country.    During more than  years of war and instability, which the Afghan people are not to blame  for,  Afghanistan  has  become  a  geopolitical  platform; and  the  world  is  well aware of the consequences of the horrible events of September 2001. The  suffering  Afghanistan  and  its  friendly  and  brotherly  nation  should  not  be dragged into the abyss of imposed bloody wars again. In this regard, the international community should not remain indifferent to the fate of the peoples and nations living in Afghanistan and its neighbors. Hence, they have a long way to go, full of military and humanitarian problems, which  have  arisen  due  to  the  reckless  decision  to  withdraw  foreign  troops  from  this country. As a close neighbor, we are always in favor of a comprehensive solution to the Afghan problem and the restoration of lasting peace and stability in this country, and we will continue to stand firm in this position. In  this  regard,  we  call  on  the  international  community  to  take  immediate  and effective measures to stabilize the difficult political and security situation and ensure peace and stability in Afghanistan through peaceful means at the earliest possible. Tajikistan  has  called  on  international  organizations,  in  particular  the  United Nations  and  the  International  Committee  of  the  Red  Cross  on  several  occasions,  to provide immediate assistance to the Afghan people. We  believe  that  the  United  Nations  should  play  a  key  role  in  advancing  this process. Dear colleagues, The peaceful people of Afghanistan are faced with terror today. We need to understand that this is not the fault of the Afghan people, but that it was organized from the outside and imposed on the Afghan people. In this case, we are talking about the massacre of civilians, former members of the national security forces and civil servants of Afghanistan. Various  terrorist  groups  are  actively  using  the  unstable  military  and  political situation in Afghanistan to strengthen their position. We  have  witnessed  the  release  of  thousands  of  members  of  ISIS,  al-Qaeda  and other terrorist groups. In other words, it is a matter of concern and regret that today Afghanistan is once again on the path to becoming a breeding ground for international terrorism. Tajikistan, which, due to its geographical location, is at the forefront of countering current  threats  and  challenges,  such  as  terrorism,  extremism,  radicalization,  drug trafficking and other transnational organized crime, will continue its efforts to prevent their further spread and believes that the support of the world community is vital in this process.     Dear colleagues, Tajikistan  is  constantly  making  joint  efforts  with  its  partners  and  international organizations,  in  particular  the  relevant  institutions  of  the  United  Nations,  to  ensure lasting peace and stability throughout the world. Successful implementation of the National Strategy of the Republic of Tajikistan on Combating Terrorism and Extremism for 2016-2020 has created a favorable basis for  the  development  and  adoption  of  a  new  Strategy  for  Combating  Terrorism  and Extremism in Tajikistan for the next five years. Countering the illicit trafficking of drugs, psychotropic substances and precursors, the proceeds of which are one of the main sources of funding for international terrorism, requires joint action and coordinated efforts by the international community. The Republic of Tajikistan, which has gained considerable experience through the implementation of its National Strategy for Combating Drug Trafficking to 2020, also contributes to combating this phenomenon at the regional and international levels. Taking into account modern methods and approaches to combat these phenomena, and in order to pursue an effective policy in this area, we have adopted our National Drugs Control Strategy for 2021-2030 in the first semester of this year. We, in Tajikistan, are well aware of the value of peace and the importance of its Mr Chairman, protection. We are satisfied with the positive experience in our country's cooperation with the United Nations in this regard. Hence, Tajikistan has always supported the peacekeeping activities of the United Nations  and  will  continue  to  make  efforts  to  contribute  to  the  restoration  and maintenance of peace and stability in the conflict zones. We intend to increase the number of our officers to contribute to this process in the future in cooperation with the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations. Moreover, in order to contribute to the implementation of the goals and objectives of  the  UN  Security Council,  to share  the  rich  experience  of Tajikistan in  countering security threats and restore full peace and stability through negotiations, we decided to nominate our country for non-permanent membership of this Council for 2028-2029. In this regard, we stand ready for cooperation with all UN member states and hope that they will support Tajikistan's candidacy. Dear colleagues, The COVID- disease and its more dangerous waves remain a cause for concern along with the above-mentioned security threats and major problems. This disease, which originally began as a health crisis, has led to a global economic crisis.     Having  recognizing  the  importance  of  cooperation  between  countries  in overcoming the negative socio-economic consequences of the pandemic, the Republic of Tajikistan welcomes the UN Comprehensive Responce to COVID- launched by the Secretary General. We also welcome the efforts of various organizations, foundations and programs of the United Nations, including the World Health Organization, in providing vaccines against this disease, as well as immediate and long-term assistance to member states. Economic and financial performance of countries and the negative consequences of  COVID-  will  delay  the  timely  implementation  of  the  Sustainable  Development Goals, especially in developing and least developed countries. Therefore, recognizing the important role of the United Nations in the effective and timely implementation of  these goals, we are  confident that  the  Decade  of  Action to achieve  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (2020-2030)  will  facilitate  to  find  effective ways to address global challenges, including climate change, poverty, gender inequality and funding. Dear colleagues, Climate change challenges are also a serious obstacle to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in various countries, including Tajikistan. Tajikistan with  percent of its territory covered by mountainous, is concerned, along with other countries in the region, about changes in the hydrological cycle leading to severe floods and droughts and causing a negative impact on water, energy and food security. Unfortunately, our country loses hundreds of millions of dollars annually as a result of water-borne disasters, and in many cases, natural disasters cause human losses and destruct the vital infrastructure. We are today on the eve of the 26th session of the United Nations Convention on Climate Change. We believe that this meeting will significantly contribute to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement and accelerating the efforts of the international community in the fight against climate change. One of the serious consequences of this process is the melting of glaciers. As a result of climate change and unprecedented warming, more than ,000 of the ,000 glaciers in Tajikistan's mountains have completely melted. According to the available statistics, the Fedchenko Glacier alone has shrunk to  square kilometers in recent decades in Tajikistan, and lost  cubic kilometers of ice. This  all  is  happening  despite  the  fact  that  up  to  %  of  Central  Asia's  water resources originate from Tajikistan's glaciers. Our country ranks 135th in the world in terms of carbon dioxide emissions and produces % of its electricity in hydropower plants.   As the leader of such a country, I have made concrete proposals at international conferences  on  several  occasions  to  find  solutions  to  the  problems  associated  with climate change. In  this  regard,  as  a  member  of  the  founding  group  of  the  World  Water  and Climate Coalition, I proposed at its first high-level meeting to declare  the years of 2025 as the International Year for Preservation of Glaciers. It is my firm belief that this initiative will help to attract more attention of the world community to the water and climate issues and the melting of glaciers. The establishment of the International Fund for Glacier Preservation under the auspices  of  the  United  Nations  is  another  step  that  could  provide  a  basis  for comprehensive research and effective solutions to this global problem. Mr Chairman, Tajikistan  is  recognized  as  an  initiator  and  lead  country  and  contributes  to  the process of promoting water and climate issues in the Global Development Agenda and submitting relevant UN resolutions on these issues. The  International  Decade  for  Action  ""Water  for  Sustainable  Development, 2018  -  2028""  initiated  by  Tajikistan  and  declared  by  the  United  Nations,  is  under implementation currently. The international community is looking forward to the United Nations Conference on the Comprehensive Medium-Term Review of this Decade, to be held in New York City in 2023. Because  in  almost    years,  this  will  be  the  second  Special  Conference  of  the United Nations on Water, which will once again prove the key role of water issues in the global development agenda and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. We are proud that Tajikistan, together with the Kingdom of the Netherlands are elected as co-chair of this important international forum. In this regard, we have already begun preparations with our partners, including the Kingdom  of  the  Netherlands  and  the  United  Nations  Department  for  Economic  and Social  Affairs,  and  are  taking  steps  to  organize  a  comprehensive  and  high-level conference. We  would  like  to  encourage  all  stakeholders  to  cooperate  extensively  in  this process. Let me recall that in 2022, our  country will host the  International  High-Level Conference  on  the  Review  of  the  International  Decade  for  Action  ""Water  for Sustainable Development"". We believe that this forum will play an important role in the preparations for the 2023 Water Conference.    Taking this opportunity, I reaffirm my country's readiness to advance water and climate issues at all levels, especially in cooperation with the United Nations. I thank you for your attention.    "
45,2021,TKM,Turkmenistan,"President of Turkmenistan at the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly Dear Mr. Secretary General! Dear Mr. President! First of all, allow me to congratulate Mr. Abdulla Shahid upon his election for the Presidency of the 76th session of the General Assembly and wish him success in this responsible position. I would like to assure you that Turkmenistan will lend you, Mr. Shahid every assistance and support.   We  would  like  to  kindly  ask  Mr.  Volkan  Bozkir  to  accept  our  deepest gratitude for his able and effective work in the position of the President of the 75th session.   Distinguished participants! The  current  state  of  global  realities,  the  nature  and  trends  of  political, economic,  social  processes  objectively  require  closer  and  coordinated  cooperation among  countries  and  major international organizations to  achieve  a  common  main goal  -  to  ensure  global  peace  and  security,  conditions  for  further  sustainable development  and  progress,  preservation  of  legal  and  institutional  basis  laid  in  the foundation of the modern world order.  The  degree  of  effectiveness  in  such  cooperation  will  largely  depend  on whether a common denominator can be found between national interests and global goals and priorities. Will we as the members of the world community have enough responsibility,  foresight,  the  political  will  to  overcome  disagreements,  tactical divergences, and differences in approaches and assessments, to focus on achieving strategic,  long-term  development  objectives,  resolving  the  most  acute  global problems  such  as  environmental,  energy,  food, issues  regarding  equitable distribution of water resources, alleviating poverty, protection from natural disasters, countering terrorism, drug-related threats, and other challenges. This fully applies to the problem of combating dangerous novel infection and mitigating  socio-economic  consequences  caused  by  its  spread.  To  be  honest,  the world  community  efforts  in  this  direction  are  still  insufficient.  Moreover,  the pandemic has exposed serious systemic failures in the international response to this challenge.   We firmly believe that when only all UN member-states and UN institutions unite, they may create conditions for success in combating a common threat.  We  underline  that  the  World  Health  Organization  is  a  major  platform  for multilateral  dialogue  to  develop  consolidated  and  mutually  agreed  responses  to common challenges in the field of global healthcare. Turkmenistan will continue to promote its previously echoed initiatives aimed at activating multilateral cooperation in science diplomacy. In particular, we propose to consider issues on instituting the following international and regional instruments during  the  76th  session.  The  World  Health  Organization  Special  Program  for studying  the  genome  of  coronavirus;  Multilateral  mechanism  of  the  World  Health Organization  to  fight  against  pneumonia;  Methodological  center  of  the  World Health  Organization  to  treat  and  prevent  acute  infections;  the  Central  Asian regional center for epidemiology, virology and bacteriology.  In  the  context  of  mitigating  the  negative  economic  implications  of  a pandemic, Turkmenistan considers that it is necessary to strengthen the UN activity in  certain  areas.  In  particular,  we  should  actively  work  on  recovering  and strengthening  resilience  of  the  international  transport  system  in  the  face  of emergencies.  There  is  a  good  foundation  for  that.  It  is  the  UN  General  Assembly Resolution “Strengthening the links between all modes of transport to achieve stable and  reliable  international  transport  for  sustainable  development  during  and  after the  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-)  pandemic”  adopted  at  the  initiative  of Turkmenistan on July , 2021.  Distinguished participants! The past period was marked by serious problems in terms of  ensuring global peace and security, exacerbating local and regional conflicts. Under  such  circumstances,  Turkmenistan,  as  a  responsible  member  of  the world  community  will  continue  to  consistently  assist  in  resolving  international issues  by  only  peaceful,  political,  and  diplomatic  means  based  on  principles  and norms  of  the  UN  Charter,  fundamental  Conventions,  and  other  international documents.  In this respect, we plan to take several practical steps for the realization of the instrument  and  reaching neutrality  potential  as  an  effective  peacemaking constructive  consensus  decisions,  implementing  the  provisions  of  the  UN  General Assembly  Resolution  “The  Role  and  Importance  of  a  Policy  of  Neutrality  in Maintaining  and  Strengthening  International  Peace,  Security  and  Sustainable Development” adopted at the initiative of Turkmenistan on December , 2020.       As  is  known,  this  year  is  declared  as  a  year  of  peace  and  trust  by  the  UN General Assembly. Being an initiator of this decision, Turkmenistan has undertaken enormous  international  work  aimed  at  strengthening  peace  culture  and  respectful dialogue,  addressing  present  trust  deficit  in  international  relations.  Turkmenistan plans to summon the International conference “The policy of peace and trust is the foundation  of  international  security,  stability,  and  development”  in  December  this year by finalizing events in the year of peace and trust. We  invite  the  UN  member-states  and  international  organizations  to  take  an active part in this event.  We  consider  that  the  subject  of  trust  and  dialogue  culture  initiated  this  year should  be  the  focus  of  global  attention  and  become  permanent  element  of  the UN strategic agenda. In this context, Turkmenistan proposes draft of General Assembly Resolution  “Strengthening  regional  and  international  cooperation  aimed  at ensuring peace, stability and sustainable development in the Central Asian region” to  develop  dialogue  mechanisms  in  Central  Asia.  We  think  that  considering  and adopting  this  document  will  promote  the  practical  implementation  of  international initiatives by the Central Asian countries stipulated in the outcome document of the Consultative Meeting of the Heads of States of Central Asia held on August , 2021, in Turkmenistan.   Concurrently, Turkmenistan reiterates its proposal to create the zone of peace, trust,  and  cooperation  in  “Central  Asia  -  Caspian  region”,  acknowledging interconnectedness  and  inseparability  of  issues  related  to  maintaining  peace, security,  and  sustainable  development  in  Central  Asia  and  the  Caspian  Sea  basin. We  consider  this  model  as  a  platform  for  promoting  initiatives  to  strengthen multilateral cooperation for global peace and development.   Dear Mr. President! Distinguished participants! The  whole  world  is  following  events  in  Afghanistan  today.  The  situation  is not  easy  there,  emerging  institutions  of  power  and  society  are  extremely  fragile.  And  therefore,  when  interpreting  and  assessing  the  situation  in  this  country,  both words and deeds require extreme consistency, balance, and responsibility.   Afghan  realities  have  changed.  The  ideological  preferences,  old  grievances, phobias,  and  stereotypes  should  be  discarded,  first  and  foremost  Afghan  people dreaming of a peaceful and calm life, tired of wars and turmoil should be considered when approaches to realities are formulated. Turkmenistan  always  puts friendship  and  good neighborliness  into  basis,  as  well  as  the  historical,  cultural  and  civilizational the  principles  of   commonality  of  the  peoples  of  the  two  countries  whilst  developing  relations  with Afghanistan. Our  country  has  been  and  remains deeply  interested  in  the  political  stability and security in Afghanistan, the well-being and unity of the fraternal Afghan people. At  the  same  time,  we  are  firm  adherents  of  resolving  contradictions  by  peaceful, political and diplomatic means. We stand for speedy normalization of the situation in Afghanistan and express hope  that  emerging  state  institutions  will  work  effectively  for  the  benefit  and interests of all Afghan people.   Turkmenistan,  for  its  part,  will  provide  comprehensive  economic  and humanitarian aid to Afghanistan as before. We are committed to finalizing ongoing projects  and  implement  new  infrastructure  projects  in  the  energy,  transport,  and communications  fields  with  Afghan  participation.  We  view  this  as  an  important condition  for  economic  and  social  recovery  in  Afghanistan  and  its  equitable  and mutually beneficial integration to world economic relations. The readiness of Turkmenistan as a neighboring and neutral state to promote the establishment of appropriate contacts and the creation of conditions for the early establishment of peace, harmony, and unity in Afghanistan remains unchanged. Distinguished participants! During this session, Turkmenistan looks forward to continuing broad dialogue on  achieving  Sustainable  Development  Goals.  In  our  view,  effective  collaboration and practical compatibility of the global, regional, and national instruments for SDG implementation have become a major priority today.    We stand for the active promotion of adequate financing of the 2030 Agenda for  Sustainable  Development.  In  this  regard,  we  think  it  is  necessary  to  organize another international conference on development financing very soon.   We will continue to pay and draw the world community’s unflagging attention to  issues  on  mitigating  the  consequences  of  an  ecological  catastrophe  of  the  Aral Sea. Turkmenistan plans to achieve the goal of establishing the UN Special Program for the Aral Sea basin with its partners from the region during the upcoming session.    The humanitarian issue remains among priorities on the cooperation agenda of Turkmenistan with the UN.  As a member of the UN Commission for Social Development for 2021-2025, Turkmenistan intends to promote strengthening its role as a main coordinating body for the development of coordinated approaches and actions in global issues of social    protection,  youth  affairs,  strengthening  the  role  of  the  traditional  family  and  other areas. Migration  policy  will  remain  an  invariably  important  area  for  cooperation between Turkmenistan and the UN. Being the permanent member of the Executive Committee  of  the  Program  of  the  High  Commissioner  for  Refugees  and  having extensive  experience  in  dealing  with  such  complex  humanitarian  situations, Turkmenistan stands ready to contribute to solving these global issues.   Distinguished participants! We are united by common thoughts and hopes, worries and threats. The more valuable is the experience gained in solving complex problems jointly, whether it is on an international scale or at the regional and national levels.  Turkmenistan  is  ready  to  share  it,  will  seek  together  with  partners  new approaches and ways to overcome challenges facing the UN. We  express  our  firm  commitment  to  cooperate  with  the  United  Nations, actively  participate  in  and  contribute  to  its  political  and  diplomatic  efforts  to preserve  and  strengthen  the  existing  architecture  of  global  security,  overcome  the consequences of the pandemic, and implement plans and programs in the economic, social, environmental, humanitarian and other fields. The partnership with the United Nations for Turkmenistan was and remains a strategic  priority,  ideological  and  practical  foundation  for  all  our  activities  in  the international arena. Thank you for your attention.   "
46,2021,UZB,Uzbekistan,"President of the Republic of Uzbekistan at the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly  September 2021 Distinguished Mr. Chairman Abdullah Shahid! Esteemed Secretary-General Antonio Guterres! Dear heads of delegations! Ladies and gentlemen! First of all, I sincerely congratulate Mr. Antonio Guterres on his re-election as the UN Secretary-General.  Today,  humanity  is  at  a  turning  point  in  its  path  of  development and the nature of international relations is changing dramatically. The  transnational  threats  to  peace,  security  and  sustainable development  are  growing.  The  climate  is  rapidly  changing.  The  mass migration flows are increasing and traditional values are declining. I  am  convinced  that  in  such  a  complex  environment,  the importance  and  role  of  the  United  Nations  and  its  specialized  agencies on a global scale is growing. It is the United Nations that must continue to play a leading role in these  important  processes  of  global  destiny  with  new  substance  and quality.  We support the Secretary-General’s efforts to strengthen solidarity and  accord  in  the  international  relations,  increase  the  efficiency  and transparency of the Organization.          Dear participants of the session! Today,  the  COVID-  pandemic,  which  became  a  global  disaster, and  its  not  only  social  and  economic,  but  also  spiritual  and  political consequences are in the focus of our attention. We  fully  support  the United  Nations’  approach  that  ensures  equal and fair access to vaccines based on the principle of no one should be left behind. I would like to take this opportunity to express my special gratitude to our foreign partners, who have provided us the practical assistance in the framework of the COVAX global platform. We are committed to further strengthening the coordinating role of the World Health Organization in effectively combating pandemic in the international recognition of vaccination results.  The  Code  of  Voluntary  Commitments  of  States  during  Pandemic, developed on the initiative of the Republic of Uzbekistan and distributed as  an  official  document  of  the  UN  General  Assembly,  is  our  practical contribution in this regard. Distinguished ladies and gentlemen! The large-scale and rapid democratic reforms that underway in our country became irreversible in recent years. Ensuring and protecting the human rights, freedoms and legitimate interests are the basis of our democratic reforms. The  strict  measures  are  being  taken  to  ensure  the  freedom  of speech  and  mass  media,  freedom  of  religion  and  conscience,  gender equality and interethnic harmony. For the first time in its history, Uzbekistan was elected as a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council. We  have  developed  the  New  Uzbekistan  Strategy  to  continue  the reform path.       The concept of this Strategy is to strengthen the role of civil society institutions,  protect  human  rights,  reduce  poverty,  provide  each  citizen with  a  guaranteed  source  of income  and  achieve  sustainable environmental development. Our main goal is to become one of the countries with above-middle income in terms of the per capita income by 2030. It  should  be  emphasized  that  this  plan  is  in  line  with  the  spirit  of the UN Sustainable Development Goals until 2030. In  this  regard,  we  propose  to  hold  an  international  conference  in Tashkent  dedicated  to  studying  the  problems  of  global  economic recovery,  the implementation  of  the  best  practices  in poverty  reduction in the post-pandemic period. It  is  well-known  that  the World  Conference  on Involving  Youth in Global Action was successfully held in our country. We  are  going  to  organize  a  Global  Educational  Forum  in  the framework  of  a  regular  dialogue  on human  rights  in  the ancient  city  of Samarkand in Uzbekistan to continue our efforts in this direction. Dear friends! We are consolidating a completely new political environment in the Central Asian region in the spirit of mutual understanding and respect, good neighborliness and strategic partnership. Our  main  objective  is  to  make  Central  Asia  a  place  of  prosperity and sustainable development, trust and friendship. To  this  end,  we  attach  priority  to  strengthening  the  interactions with neighboring and adjacent regions. In  this  regard,  we  have  put  forward  a  proposal  to  adopt  a  special Resolution  of  the  United  Nations  General  Assembly  on  strengthening the interconnectivity of Central and South Asia. I  would  like  to  underscore  once  again  that  Afghanistan  is  an integral part of Central Asia.      It  is  not  only  us  and  the  neighboring  states,  but  also  the  whole world are interested in the establishment of peace and tranquility in this country. Therefore, we are always doing our best to help the Afghan people. We  have  recently  opened  the  Uzbek-Afghan  border  and  resumed the  supply  of  basic-needs  and  oil  products,  as  well  as  electricity  to  this country. During  these  challenging  times, it is impossible  to isolate Afghanistan and leave it within the range of its problems. As it is well known, last year, from this high rostrum, we proposed to establish a permanent UN Committee on Afghanistan. The influence and voice of the United Nations on Afghanistan must be heard louder than ever. The growing number of threats and conflicts, transnational threats in  the  world  requires  further  strengthening  of  the  international cooperation. The  presentation  of  the  results  of  the  ten-year  plan  of  the  UN Global  Counter-Terrorism  Strategy  in  Central  Asia  in  Tashkent  in November  this  year  and  holding  an  international  conference  on  the prospects will undoubtedly serve these noble purposes. The signing of a Regional Program for Central Asia for 2022-2025 with  the  United  Nations  Office  on  Drugs  and  Crime  will  lay  a  solid foundation for the actions in this direction. As  we  continue  our  efforts  in  this  regard,  we  intend  to  develop  a joint action plan against drugs with the participation of this UN Office, covering the countries of Central and South Asia. Dear participants of the session! Uzbekistan  pays  a  special  attention  to  combatting  the  climate change, protecting the environment and biodiversity. This is our noble human duty not only for today, but also before the future generations.    I would like to take this opportunity to express my deep gratitude to all  Member  States  for  the  adoption  of  a  Special  Resolution  of  the  UN General  Assembly  declaring  the  Aral  Sea  Region  as  a  zone  of environmental innovation and technology.  We are determined to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. We are taking concrete steps to move towards the renewable energy sources. In  particular,  it  is  envisaged  to  double  the  energy  efficiency  of  our economy  by  2030,  increase  the  share  of  renewable  energy  by  %  and develop environmentally clean transport. By  2025,  it  is  scheduled  to  commission  the  new  solar  and  wind power plants with a total capacity of ,900 megawatts. In  2022,  we  intend  to  hold  a  High-Level  International  Forum  in cooperation  with  the  United  Nations  on  green  energy  in  the  Aral  Sea Region in the city of Nukus. We support the adoption of the Global Biodiversity Program in the near future. In addition, in the future we stand ready to host one of the meetings of the parties to the Biodiversity Convention in our country. Along with this, we propose to hold the Sixth High-Level Assembly under  the  auspices  of  the  United  Nations  in  2023  in  Uzbekistan  for  in-depth discussions of the priorities of global environmental policy. The  participants  of  the  Assembly  will  have  an  opportunity  to  learn about the difficult situation in the Aral Sea Region, which is the center of an ecological disaster caused by the drying up of the Aral  Sea, and draw the necessary conclusions. In addition, we intend to  put forward an initiative in the Assembly to develop a Global Environment Charter aimed at laying the foundations of a new environmental policy of the United Nations.  Distinguished ladies and gentlemen!    Uzbekistan  is  always  ready  to  develop  the  mutually  beneficial, long-term  and  multifaceted  partnership  with  all  countries  of  the  world and global organizations. I  am  confident  that  we  will  continue  to  strengthen  our  close cooperation aimed at sustainable growth, safe and a prosperous future. Thank you for your attention!  "
47,2021,PRK,Democratic People's Republic of Korea,"President, Mr. Secretary General, Distinguished delegates, First of all, I would like to congratulate you, Mr. Abdulla Shahid, on your election  as  the  President  of  the  76th  Session  of  the  United  Nations  General Assembly (UNGA). I expect that your able  stewardship will lead this session to a good success. I hope this session will serve as an important occasion for all UN member states  in  the  face  of  unprecedented  challenges  and  crisis  to  share  useful experiences  with  each  other in  overcoming  difficulties,  promoting socio-economic recovery, and opening up a new future through hope. Mr. President,   COVID-, which took the precious lives of about . million people, is still raging, worsening the socio-economic situations around the globe, such as economic  stagnation,  racial discrimination  and widening the gap between the rich and the poor.     Global warming is giving rise to destructive abnormal weather affecting simultaneously every part of the world.  It teaches us a serious lesson that no one should turn a blind eye to the climate change. To make matters worse, due to the selfish and unjust behaviors of some UN  member  states  and  specific  forces,  conflicts  and  ethnic  disputes  amon g countries  and  nations  never  cease  with  innocent  people  suffering  in  many regions of the world including the Middle East, Africa and South East Asia. It is no exaggeration to say that the international community is faced with the most serious crisis since the founding of the UN. This reality urgently  requires all the UN  member states  to find a proper solution to the problems, while remaining more faithful than ever before to the UN  Charter,  international  law  and  fundamental  principles  of  international relations,  pooling  their  political  will  and  efforts  and  strengthening  mutual cooperation. Mr. President,   I would like first of all to inform you about the efforts of the Democratic for  anti-epidemic  work  and (DPRK) People's  Republic  of  Korea socio-economic development, with a view to making active contribution to the discussion of the theme of this session on recovering from global health crisis and building socio-economic resilience. The  circumstances  of  the  DPRK  is  extremely  unfavorable  due  to  the external factors, compared with other countries. However,  the  DPRK  is  never  daunted  or  captivated  by  the  surrounding circumstances. It is vigorously advancing along the track of development that it  has  aimed  for,  based  on  the  most  stable  and  solid  political  environment  in the  world,  overcoming  by  its  own  efforts  all  kinds  of  disturbing  factors  and challenges standing ahead.   Proud  and  precious  successes  have  been  achieved  thanks  to  the  steady efforts  made  by  the  DPRK  government  for  socio-economic  development  and improvement of the people's living standard. At the present time, it is the core policy of the DPRK government to cope with the global health crisis and climate change with a foresighted plan and to   provide  people  with  a  more  stable  and  improved  living  conditions  while sustainably increasing the agricultural production.   Regarding  it  as  a  vital  issue  to  tightly  quarantine  the  inroads  of takes  comprehensive  anti-epidemic COVID-, measures, evoking an all-people empathy and ensuring unity of action. the  DPRK  government The  DPRK  delegation  believes  that  in  recovering  from  COVID-,  it  is important  for  each  country  to  take  anti-epidemic  measures  suitable  to  its specific conditions, with a high sense of responsibility for the life and safety of its own people. In the face of the global pandemic still spreading with a protracted nature, we will reliably safeguard the life and safety of the people and the well-being of  the  country  by  reinforcing  the  existing  anti-epidemic  measures  with  more improved and safer ones.   Mr. President,   Despite  the  continued  global  health  crisis  and  abnormal  weather conditions,  we  have  made  not  a  few  achievements  in  social  and  economic development and improvement of the people's living standard.   Industrial  sector  has  been  placed  on  the  upward  track  as  we  have concentrated  a  lot  of  efforts  on  strengthening  the  country's  capabilities  for self-supporting  development.  And  a  good  prospect  is  opened  also  in agricultural sector for ensuring the fulfilment of the grain production plan this year on sound footing by minimizing the effects of disastrous climate.   The  Workers'  Party  of  Korea  (WPK)  invariably  maintains  it  as  the supreme principle of its activities to provide the Korean people with stable life and to steadily improve it. In  accordance  with  a  decision  made  at  an  important  meeting  held  some time  ago,  our  country  has  taken  measures  to  regularly  provide  the  children throughout  the  country  with  nutritious  food  such  as  dairy  products  free  of charge at state's expense, even at this hard time. Tens  of  thousands  of  advanced  houses  are  built  annually  at  state's expense  and  allocated  to  people,  thanks  to  the  people-oriented  policy  of  the DPRK government.     In regard to the issue of climate change, too, the DPRK government has formulated  a  plan  to  mainly  complete  river  improvement,  afforestation  for erosion  control,  dyke  maintenance  and  tide  embankment  projects  across  the country,  and to enter into their  regular management during the  five-year plan period,  and  it  is  taking  strict  measures  for  crisis  management  in  order  to minimize natural disasters including from flood and typhoon. I  want  to  believe  that  the  achievements  made  by  the  DPRK  in  dealing with  global  health  crisis  and  disastrous  climate  change  will  make  a  positive contribution  to  the  efforts  of  the  international  community  to  recover  from COVID- and build sustainable socio-economic resilience.   Difficulties  are  much  bigger  than  at  any  time,  and  big  and  small challenges and threats exist in the surrounding environments. Even under these circumstances,  we  have  created  successes  which  are  fully  welcomed  and supported  by  our  people,  and  we  are  steadily  effecting  development  changes by  our  own  efforts.  This  is  the  result  of  the  correct  political  guidance  of  our Party and the state leadership. All people trust in the Party and the government, united in one mind  and destiny.  Herein  lies  the  invincible  power  of  our  state  and  the  source  of  its inexhaustible strength. Mr. President,   The DPRK became the 160th member state of the United Nations when the first plenary meeting of the UNGA at its 46th session adopted a resolution with  unanimity  to  admit  the  Republic  to  its  membership  on  September  , 1991,  years ago. As  the  country  and  nation  remained  divided,  the  Republic  originally could  not  but  consider  joining  the  UN  from  the  perspective  of  achieving reunification. Therefore, we consistently maintained the position that the north and the south of Korea join the UN with the single name of the country after achieving reunification based on confederacy or take one common seat if they would join the UN prior to reunification. But  the  anti-reunification  and-  anti-national  attempts  got  ever  more undisguised  to  make  the  national  division  permanent  and  legitimate,  and  to isolate  the  Republic  internationally  by  using  the  UN  membership  issue. Against this backdrop, we took a decisive measure to join the UN on our own   initiative. The  Korean  nation,  which  lived  on  the  same  territory  for  thousands  of years with the same bloodline through generations, was artificially divided by the outside forces in the middle of the 20th century and in the end, joined the UN with two seats. This is a tragedy indeed. As a result of the World War II, the United Nations was established with the  primary  responsibility  to  maintain  international  peace  and  security.  But contrary  to  this,  the  Korean  peninsula  was  divided  into  two  against  the  will and  aspiration  of  the  Korean  nation,  thus  undergoing  constant  tension  and instability. Consequently,  this  became  the  root  cause  of  pains  and  misfortunes inflicting  upon  the  Korean  nation,  which  can  never  be  forgotten  from generation to generation. Nobody will deny this fact.   It  is  also  the  desire  of  the  international  community  to  see  peaceful resolution of the issue of the Korean peninsula in the interests of the Korean nation.   It is from this viewpoint that I take this opportunity to clarify the position of  the  DPRK  on  the  root  cause  of  the  still  unresolved  issue  of  the  Korean peninsula and on the fundamental ways to ensure lasting peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. Mr. President,   The principle of solution to a problem is to find out its root cause before coming up with a prescription for it. Three decades have passed since the end of the Cold War. But the Korean peninsula is still in a vicious cycle of ever-looming aggravation of tension and confrontation. Its main root cause lies in the hostile policy towards the DPRK. Until now, no less number of UN member states are not well aware of the fact  that  the  issue  of  the  Korean  peninsula  has  its  origin  in  the  U.S.  hosti le policy on the DPRK. Worse still, they have a misconception that the U.S. has become hostile towards the DPRK due to the nuclear issue. When  it  comes  to  the  nuclear  issue,  it  is  not  the  DPRK's  possession  of nukes  that  the  U.S.  became  hostile  towards  us.  On  the  contrary,  we  have   traversed an inevitable course of history as the U.S., the biggest nuclear power in the world, has been posing nuclear threats, antagonizing the DPRK for more than  years. The  U.S.  hostile  policy  towards  the  DPRK  is  not  at  all  abstract.  It  is  in itself military threats and hostile acts we are facing from the U.S. every day. From  the  first  day  of  the  foundation  of  the  DPRK,  the  U.S.  has  not recognized our sovereignty treating us as an enemy state, and openly showed its hostility towards the socialist system chosen by our people.   The  U.S.  designated  the  DPRK  as  a  ""communist  state""  and  a  ""state  of non-market  economy"",  and  it  completely  blocked,  both  institutionally  and legislatively, the establishment of relations between the DPRK and the U.S. in the  fields  of  politics,  economy  and  trade,  under  the  unreasonable  pretexts  of ""human rights issue"", ""proliferation of the WMD"", ""sponsoring of terrorism"", ""oppression of religion"", ""money laundering"" and etc. If it is not a hostile policy, should it be called a ""friendly policy""?   The U.S. hostile policy against the DPRK finds its clearest expression in its military threats against us.   Not a single foreign troop, not a single foreign military base exists in the territory  of  the  DPRK.  But  in  south  Korea,  almost  ,000  U.S.  troops  are stationing  at  numerous  military  bases,  maintaining  a  war  posture  to  take military action against the DPRK at any moment. The DPRK has no record of having conducted a military exercise even a single time around the U.S., but the U.S. has annually staged all sorts of war drills on and around the Korean peninsula and in the Korean waters for the last several  decades,  by  mobilizing  army,  naval  and  air  forces  across  the  world including  the  U.S.  troops  in  south  Korea,  and  it  has  threatened  us  through military  demonstrations  of  intimidating  nature  while  deploying  numerous armaments to south Korea from time to time. In  August  2021,  the  U.S.  and  south  Korea  defiantly  conducted  the ''combined command exercise"" despite our repeated warnings. This exercise is an  outright  war  drill  of  offensive  nature  that  simply  changed  its  name  of  the joint military exercises staged by the U.S. for the last several decades.   Inter-Korean  relations  have  never  come  out  of  the  shadow  of  the  U.S. interference and obstruction as the U.S. has stationed its troops in south Korea and  bound  it  with  the  chains  of  military  alliance,  and  the  inter-Korean agreements  have  never  been  implemented  faithfully  owing  to  the  wrong behavior  of  the  south  Korean  authorities  prioritizing  cooperation  with  an ""alliance"" over the harmony of the nation. The international community should not overlook one fact. The DPRK-U.S. relations are not merely the relations between unfriendly countries  without  diplomatic  relations  but  between  the  belligerent  countries which are legally in a state of war. The possible outbreak of a new war on the Korean peninsula is contained not because of the U.S.’s mercy on the DPRK.   It  is  because  our  state  is  growing  reliable  deterrent  that  can  control  the hostile forces in their attempts for military invasion. We have stored reliable power to defend ourselves by exerting continuous efforts, with a clear insight into the demand of the times which necessitates us to possess sufficient might for national defense in the face of the geopolitical environment  and  the  balance  of  power  on  the  Korean  peninsula  as  well  as ever-straining international relations. On  the  earth,  there  is  no  country  which  is  under  constant  threat  of  war like the DPRK, and so much strong is its people's desire for peace.   What  we  mean  by  the  war  deterrent  is  literally  the  righteous  right  to self-defense that can deter aggressive war and defend ourselves. As  the  whole  world  knows  and  as  the  U.S.  is  so  much  concerned, powerful offensive means are, of course, included in our war deterrent. However,  we  do  not  want  to  use  those  means  aiming  at  somebody.  In other  words,  we  would  never  violate  nor  endanger  the  security  of  the  U.S., south Korea and our neighboring countries. We are just building up our national defense in order to defend ourselves and reliably safeguard the security and peace of the country. For  this  reason,  we  do  not  imprudently  use  such  expression  that  we  are   building  up  military  power  which  is  good  enough  to  ""deter""  somebody's ""provocation"". However,  the  military  threats  against  the  DPRK  by  the  U.S.  and  its servile forces are evolving constantly with the passage of time. Annually,  the  U.S.  spends  astronomical  amount  of  money  amounting  to more  than  US$  700  billion  on  the  development  of  ultra-supersonic  weapons, long-range  precision  guided  armaments,  ICBM  of  a  new  generation,  nuclear strategic bombers, all of which are bound to be used first against the DPRK in the future Korean war. Recently,  the  south  Korean  authorities  is  hell-bent  on  developing ultra-modern weapons under the tacit approval and patronage of the U.S., and numerous  war  equipment  have  been  shipped  into  south  Korea.  These  are  all  too dangerous moves that break the balance of military power on the Korean peninsula. Given  that  the  U.S.  and  the  U.S.-south  Korea  military  alliance  increase military  threats  against  the  DPRK,  nobody  can  deny  the  righteous  right  to self-defense  for  the  DPRK  to  develop,  test,  manufacture  and  possess  the weapon  systems  equivalent  to  the  ones  which  are  possessed  or  being developed by them. Mr. President,   Kim  Jong  Un,  President  of  the  State  Affairs,  in  his  report  at  the  8th Congress  of  WPK,  stated  that  the  key  to  establishing  new  DPRK-U.S. relationship lies in the U.S. withdrawal of its hostile policy toward the DPRK and  expressed  the  principled  stand  that  we  would  approach  the  U.S.  on  the principle of power for power and goodwill for goodwill in the future, too. The U.S. has now two options.   One  is  to  contribute  to  the  peace  and  stability  of  the  Korean  peninsula and  the  world  by  withdrawing  the  anachronistic  hostile  policy  towards  the DPRK in a bold and complete manner.   The  successive  U.S.  administrations  have  repeatedly  expressed  their intentions,  both  in  verbal  and  written  forms,  that  they  had  no  hostile  intent towards the DPRK, advocating dialogue with us. But as can be seen in reality,   all  of  those  were  nothing  more  than  flowery  words  to  cover  up  their  hostile policy. The  current  U.S.  administration  should prove  its  policy  stand  that  ""they have  no  hostile  intent  towards  the  DPRK""  by  practical  actions  instead  of words.   It should also remove the double standards towards the DPRK. If  the  U.S.  shows  its  bold  decision  to  give  up  its  hostile  policy,  we  are also prepared to respond willingly at any time. But it is our judgment that there is no prospect, at the present stage, for the U.S. to really withdraw its hostile policy towards the DPRK. Nevertheless,  we  would  not  implore  the  U.S.  to  abandon  its  hostility towards us. In the course of the DPRK-U.S. showdown spanning over half a century, we have been very much accustomed to the U.S. military threats, and we know well how to deal with the U.S., the most hostile country.   We  have  learned  the  mode  of  existence  to  cope  with  the  U.S.  hostile policy and accumulated rich experience. We will continue to keep eyes on the move of the U.S. policy towards the DPRK. If  the  current  U.S.  administration  tries  to  solve  the  issue  of  the  Korean peninsula,  which  had  not  been  solved  by  the  preceding  administrations,  by relying  on  the  anachronistic  method  of  calculation  like  the  present  one,  the result would not be different from the past. If the U.S. continues to commit such acts to threaten us as to provoking us  to  a  quarrel  more  often  than  not  and  depending  on  the  legacy  of  the  cold war  like  the  military  alliance,  it  would  really  turn  out  to  be  unfavorable  for them. Some time ago, the U.S. administration announced that it had terminated the longest war which lasted  for  years, while withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan.   But the U.S. is still ignoring the reality that the Korean war has not ended for over  years. If  the  U.S.  wants  to  see  the  Korean  war,  the  most  prolonged  and long-lasting  war  in  the  world,  come  to  an  end,  and  if  it  is  really  desirous  of peace and reconciliation on the Korean peninsula, it should take the first step towards  giving  up  its  hostile  policy  against  the  DPRK  by  stopping permanently  the  joint  military  exercises  and  the  deployment  of  all  kinds  of strategic  weapons  which  are  levelled  at  the  DPRK  in  and  around  the  Korean peninsula. I am convinced that  a good prospect will be opened  for the DPRK-U.S. relations  and  the  inter-Korean  relations  if  the  U.S.  refrains  from  threatening the DPRK and gives up its hostility towards it. Mr. President,   Pandemic  crisis,  climate  change,  refugee  problem  and  endless  disputes among  countries  are  arising  as  burning  issues  in  the  world.  Backdrop  to  this lies the self-serving policies of interference of the U.S. and the West. The Afghan crisis has claimed the lives of tens of thousands of innocent people and triggered the flow of millions of refugees as well as the collapse of the state and social system. This is a clear testimony to the tragic consequences caused by the open use of armed forces against a sovereign state,  interference in their internal affairs and occupation of foreign troops. The  reality  urgently  demands  that  the  United  Nations  turn  into  a  fair international organization with strong executive power discharging its inherent mission in conformity with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. What  comes  as  an  urgent  task  here  is  to  make  the  United  Nations Security  Council  (UNSC)  an impartial  and  responsible  body  which substantially contributes to maintaining the international peace and security, as explicitly stipulated in the UN Charter. The  UNSC  is  not  a  political  instrument  with  which  some  big  powers decide  at  their  own  wills  the  international  relations  and  the  destiny  of sovereign  states  with  the  yardstick  of  double  standards  on  the  basis  of  their interests and priorities.   The  UNSC  does  not  say  a  single  word  about  the  reckless  arms  buildup and war criminal acts by specific countries such as the U.S. and its following forces.  It  instead  finds  faults  with  the  just  self-defensive  measures  of  the DPRK at every chance.   This is a telltale evidence that the UN does not represent the interests of broad spectrum of the international community but, rather degenerates into an ""inner room"" for a few privileged group. In  order  to  prevent  the  high-handedness  and  arbitrariness  of  the  UNSC, representation  of  developing  countries,  which  take  up  majority  in  the  UN, should be increased. It  is  also  imperative  that  the  rules  and  procedures  of  the  UN  should  be revised  so  that  the  resolutions  adopted at  the  UNSC  could  be  rejected  by  the UNGA resolution containing the will of the overwhelming majority of member states, when necessary. Next,  for  the  UN  to  be  a  fair  organization  with  practical  ability,  we should  revitalize  the  work  of  the  UN  based  on  the  principles  of  sovereign equality and respect for equal rights and self-determination of the people. Ensuring  sovereign  equality  and rights  and self-determination  of  the  people  constitutes  the  hard  core  of  the  UN  Charter, and it is the cornerstone of very existence of the UN.   for  equal respect Some  UN  member  states  try  to  unilaterally  impose  the  western  values and  ""rules  based  international  order""  upon  sovereign  states  behind  the signboard  of  ""defending  democracy""  and  ""protecting  human  rights"".  Such  an attempt to interfere in the internal affairs is a gross violation of the principle of sovereign equality.   Chaos,  disorder,  bloodshed  and  violence  continue  unabated  in  some countries owing to foreign intervention. These unhappy events prove that the human  rights  are  immediately  sovereign  rights  and  that,  if  it  is  lost,  people cannot avoid the fate of stateless nation fraught with disgrace and humiliation. The UN should get away with double standards as well as unjust behavior of  leaning  towards  positions  of  some  countries  and  specific  force.  It  should ensure  full  impartiality  and  fairness  as  required  by  the  UN  Charter,  the backbone of which is the principle of sovereign equality and respect for equal   rights and self-determination of the people. The  DPRK  delegation  avails  itself  of  this  opportunity  to  extend  its  full support and encouragement to the Cuban government and people who continue to move forward holding aloft the banner of socialism in the face of the U.S. moves to impose illegal sanctions and blockade and to undermine Cuba from within. I also express our constant support to and solidarity with the independent countries  including  Syria  and  Palestine  and  their  peoples  in  their  unyielding struggle to defend the national dignity, sovereignty and territorial integrity.  Mr. President, The  DPRK  remains  unchanged  in  its  underlying  foreign  policy  ideas  of independence, peace and friendship. In the future, too, the DPRK will discharge its responsibilities and duties to strengthen friendship and unity with all countries of the world which respect our  sovereignty,  achieve  genuine  international  justice  and  equality,  and  to ensure peace and security on the Korean peninsula and in the rest of the world.   Thank you.   "
48,2021,JPN,Japan,"President, Let me start by expressing my deepest sympathies to those who have passed away due to COVID-. I would also like to convey my deepest respect for healthcare workers and all who are at the forefront of the fight against the pandemic. The Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games were held with the aim of building a peaceful and better world through sport, under the Olympic Truce Resolution adopted in  this  very  venue  of  the  General Assembly.  While  there  were  various  views  about holding the  Games  this  summer,  we,  as  the  host  country  of  the  Games,  fulfilled our responsibilities and achieved what we set out to do. Many people were deeply moved by the outstanding performances of the athletes which gave hopes and dreams to everyone across the globe. The Games also demonstrated the “barrier-free mindset” to the world, with aspirations for an inclusive society where all people with or without disabilities support each other to live in harmony. Above all, while humanity has been faced with immeasurable hardships, the Tokyo 2020 Games proved to be a symbol of global unity among people around the world. I would like to commend all the athletes who inspired us with their performances and express my gratitude to all who made this event possible. Mr. President, Many  challenges  confronting  us,  such  as  climate  change,  economic  recovery  and competition with authoritarianism, require our collective efforts. In particular, COVID- has inflicted unprecedented health crises, causing profound changes to people’s lives and global systems. We now face questions on how to overcome these crises and build a better future. Today, I would like to share with you Japan’s vision of how to address these urgent challenges which could shape the course of the world. Mr. President,                  Let me first talk about how we will overcome this pandemic.   “Save as many lives as possible, and leave no one's health behind.” This has been the conviction  that  Japan,  as  a  country  upholding  human  security  and  universal  health coverage, and I myself, have adhered to throughout this battle against the pandemic. Japan is determined to lead the global efforts to this end.   It is particularly important to ensure equitable access to vaccines in every corner of the world, which is the decisive factor in the fight against the pandemic. We must create an environment  where  all  countries  and  regions  can  secure  vaccines  equitably  with  no political or economic conditions. With this in mind, I co-hosted the COVAX AMC Summit together with Gavi in June this year. We were able to secure funds, including USD  billion from Japan, that go well beyond the funding target of securing . billion vaccine doses for  percent of the population of developing economies. Additionally, Japan has provided countries and regions with approximately  million doses  of  vaccines  manufactured  in  Japan  through  the  COVAX  facility  and  other initiatives so far. Today, I am pleased to announce that, with additional contributions, Japan will provide up to  million vaccine doses in total. At  the  same  time,  we  will  steadily  implement  Japan’s  “Last  One  Mile  Support” programme to ensure the delivery of vaccines to vaccination centers in each country and region.   Through these initiatives, Japan has provided assistance of the order of USD . billion worldwide and will continue to make the utmost effort in overcoming COVID-.   Mr. President, I would like to share with you four points that Japan considers particularly important in guiding our world towards a better future. First, we need to build resilient global health systems. We must learn from this pandemic and prepare ourselves for the future. Our experiences this  time  have  taught  us  that  there  should  be  no  geographical  vacuum  in  addressing global health issues, and it is important that relevant information and knowledge on all countries  and  regions  is  shared  promptly  and  extensively  in  a  free  and  transparent manner. From this perspective, Japan attaches importance to the role of WHO and will continue              actively contributing to discussions on its review and reform. The pandemic has also led to renewed recognition of the importance of universal health coverage. In order to ensure equitable access to health care services and protection for socially  vulnerable  people,  Japan  intends  to  formulate  its  “Global  Health  Strategy,” thereby  contributing  to  building  a  new  architecture  for  global  health  security  in collaboration with the international community. I should also speak to the discussions in the United Nations on human security of the new generation, which I proposed at this very venue last year. Japan will render its full support  to  these  discussions  with  high  expectations  that  they  will  provide  valuable guidance for the future, not only in global health, but in addressing various challenges across the world. To build more resilient global health systems based on the principles of human security, it is necessary to tackle not only infectious diseases, but a broad range of relevant areas such as nutrition, water and sanitation. Japan will host the Tokyo Nutrition for Growth Summit 2021 in December this year to improve nutrition for people around the world. Second, we need to create a green and sustainable society. Climate change is an imminent challenge that calls for the collective efforts of humanity as a whole to resolve. At the same time, addressing climate change will be the driving force of dynamic growth and a necessity for achieving  the Sustainable Development Goals.   Japan aims to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by  percent in fiscal year 2030 from its fiscal year 2013 levels, setting an ambitious target which is aligned with the long-term  goal  of  achieving  net-zero  by  2050.  Furthermore,  Japan  will  continue strenuous efforts in its challenge to meet the lofty goal of cutting its emission by  percent.  I  would  like  to  encourage  other  countries  including  major  emitters  to  make further efforts as well. In  achieving  global  decarbonization,  any  developing  country  which  genuinely  needs assistance should not be left behind. Japan will provide climate finance, both public and private, to developing countries including small island states, totalling approximately USD  billion over the next five years from 2021 to 2025. With these efforts, Japan is resolved to take the lead in achieving global decarbonization and creating a green and sustainable society. Third, I would like to emphasize the importance of a free and open international order based on the rule of law.            We must uphold universal values such as freedom, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law that our predecessors have established to maintain peace and prosperity in each region and in the world. I am convinced that the foundation of this undertaking is not force, but a free and open international order. Our vision for achieving this task is the Free and Open Indo-Pacific. Japan will closely collaborate with like-minded countries and regions and work strategically to fulfill this vision. At the same time, Japan continues to play a leading role in the establishment of a free and  fair  economic  order.  In  the  area  of  digital  technology,  Japan  will  exercise  its leadership in making rules to advance the Data Free Flow with Trust in order to counter protectionism and inward-looking tendencies. As we maximize the use of the potential of digital space, new technologies must not be used to undermine our universal values. Japan will contribute constructively to the discussions at the UN and other multilateral forums and also provide capacity-building support to ASEAN and other countries in order to work towards the realization of a free, fair, and secure cyber-space. Moreover, infrastructure building and development finance under appropriate rules are also essential to build back better and achieve growth. Japan will further promote and implement  its  ""Quality  Infrastructure  Investment""  programme  and  take  the  lead  in establishing  an  environment  where  all  countries  abide  by  the  international  rules  on development finance with transparency and fairness. Fourth, we must realize a more peaceful and secure international community. Japan is determined to play a proactive role in the maintenance of international peace and security and in establishing a rules-based international order, with the support from Member States at the election of non-permanent members of the Security Council in 2022. Japan will also remain committed to peacebuilding. At the same time, Japan calls for the launch of concrete negotiations for the reform of the Security Council in order to make it a more effective body that reflects the realities of the 21st century. To realize a more peaceful and secure world, it is crucial for all countries to make sincere efforts  in  a  transparent  manner  in  international  arrangements  on  arms  control  and disarmament.              As the only country that has experienced the devastation of atomic bombings, Japan will endeavor to bridge the gaps among countries with different positions and contribute to international  efforts  towards  the  realization  of  a  world  free  from  nuclear  weapons. Regarding the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, we aim to achieve a meaningful outcome at the Review Conference to be held next year.   We will also continue to work on the control and disarmament of conventional weapons, or “Disarmament that Saves Lives”. Japan also continues to actively engage in promoting the peace and stability of the Indo-Pacific region. We must prevent Afghanistan, which is still under a tense situation, from becoming a safe  haven  for  terrorists  once  again.  It  is  imperative  to  ensure  that  humanitarian  aid organizations can safely deliver assistance and that human rights, especially those of women, are protected. We will carefully monitor the actions, not words, of the Taliban, to see whether or not they  will  honor  the  commitments  they  have  publicly  announced. We  will  also  work closely with relevant countries and organizations to that end. The recent launch of ballistic missiles by North Korea is a clear violation of Security Council  resolutions  and  we  condemn  this  action.  The  recent  nuclear  and  missile activities by North Korea pose a threat to the peace and security of Japan, the region and  the  international  community.  I  strongly  hope  that  North  Korea  will  engage  in diplomatic  efforts  and  the  dialogues  between  the  United  States  and  North  Korea  on denuclearization will progress. The  issue  of  abductions  by  North  Korea  is  a  matter  of  serious  concern  for  the international community and also a top priority for Japan. As the families of the victims continue to age, there is no time to lose before we resolve the abductions issue. Japan will continue to seek to normalize its relationship with North Korea, in accordance with the Japan-DPRK Pyongyang Declaration, through comprehensively resolving the outstanding issues of concern such as the abductions, nuclear and missile issues, as well as settling the unfortunate past. Establishing a constructive relationship between Japan and North Korea will not only serve the interests of both sides but also contribute to regional peace and stability.   Turning to Myanmar, Japan spares no efforts in supporting the will of the people of Myanmar to achieve democratization and the protection of human rights. We strongly support ASEAN's initiatives towards a breakthrough in the current situation and will            work closely with the international community. Today,  I  discussed  how  to  overcome  the  pandemic  and  the  role  Japan  will  play  in realizing a better world. What I have consistently emphasized across these points are international collaboration and multilateralism. Mr. President, Ten years ago, Japan suffered an unprecedented scale of devastation due to the Great East  Japan  Earthquake.  The  international  community  kindly  extended  countless assistance to Japan, which allowed our country to take steps towards recovery. These  experiences  remind  us  of  the  importance  of  international  collaboration.  Japan continues  to  further  promote  multilateralism,  so  that  we  can  resolve  the  challenges facing the world and advance ""Our Common Agenda"" as upheld by the UN. In this regard, we attach importance to dialogues with partners in various regions. In July, we hosted the Pacific Islands Leaders Meeting, and next year, we aim to elevate the  cooperative  relationship  between  Japan  and Africa  to  new  heights  at  TICAD  , which will be held in Tunisia. Japan will also host the Sixth World Assembly for Women (WAW!) next year to realize gender equality and promote the empowerment of women in the world, in cooperation with the international community, particularly UN Women and other partners. Japan is determined to do its utmost in collaboration with the members of the United Nations to overcome the crisis and build back better for a world full of hope. Thank you very much for your kind attention.           "
49,2021,MNG,Mongolia,"President, Mr. Secretary-General, Distinguished delegates, Ladies and gentlemen, I wish to convey my heartfelt congratulations to Your Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid on your unanimous election as the President of the General Assembly and wish every success in the work of the 76th Session. I pledge my delegation’s full support and cooperation in carrying out your responsible duties. In the past two years, countries around the world have been plagued by the unforeseen pandemic and going through arduous times together. On behalf of the people of Mongolia, I would like to express my deepest condolences for the loss of . million lives worldwide due to  the  coronavirus.  Taking  this  opportunity,  I  would  like  to  extend  my  sincere  gratitude  to doctors,  medical  personnel  and  frontline  workers,  who  are  tirelessly  serving  to  safeguard precious lives and health of people in every corner of our planet.  I also would like to express my sincere appreciation to the United Nations and its system organizations for their tremendous role in combating the COVID- pandemic by uniting and assisting all Member States, and providing them with information and guidance. Mr. President,  As the pandemic has affected not only global health, but also all spheres of economic, social and political life, it became evident that the human history will be divided into pre- and post-COVID- periods.  We have learned a number of lessons from the pandemic. Mongolians say that “Disease never knocks on the door”, which implies that the disease does not discriminate by race, age, gender, and wealth.  This proverb also demonstrates the Mongolian morality of taking care of ones in trouble and ensure not to maltreat them.    We  should  think  that  rather  than  discriminating  each  other,  we  should  focus  on combining  our  strengths  and  overcome  this  perilous  pandemic  the  humankind  is  facing.          Moreover, there were protests and insurgencies against lockdowns and home orders in some countries.  As a so called “oasis of democracy” in the region, Mongolia has been closely observing human rights issues stemmed from the pandemic lockdown. The fact that Mongolia and many other Asian countries have been going through the COVID-  crisis  without  substantial  human  rights  conflicts  discloses  the  advantage  of communalistic  culture  of  Asians  over  the  individualistic  one.  I  firmly  believe  that  respecting each other’s culture and value, as well as learning from each other’s successes and failures are of utmost importance in collectively overcoming the challenges that humanity may face in the future.   The sudden outbreak of COVID- has placed an enormous strain on the global health, particularly in human resource, infrastructure and supply chain, and with the lingering spread of COVID- infection, the reality of social injustice has been revealed vividly.   The outbreak of the pandemic has also alarmed the modern nation states that the health sector possesses an existential importance equal to the defense sector.  The  concept  of  global  development  should  not  only  be  green  and  accessible  socio-economic development, but also there is an emerging need that it needs to be formulated in deep  consideration  of  health  and  health  diplomacy.  Moreover,  there  is  a  pressing  need  in health  sector  to  improve  risk  management,  preparedness,  investment,  promotion  of  public-private partnership, and expediated penetration of high technology and innovation.  World  countries  and  international  community  are  directing  their  collective  efforts  and mutual assistance to vaccination, as it is considered to be the best protection from COVID-.  As of today, the COVAX program, which aims to ensure equitable access to the COVID-  vaccine,  have  delivered  190  million  doses  of  vaccines  to  138  countries,  which  is  an invaluable support to low- and middle-income countries. In Mongolia,  percent of the population has been fully vaccinated against COVID- with the support of other countries and the Government procurement in addition to the COVAX supply.  In Mongolia, there is a declining trend in virus spread though it has been high in the last months;  thus,  the  Government  has  started  taking  gradual  steps  to  return  to  normal  life  by opening  services,  launching  classroom  training  and  increasing  the  number  of  international flights. Mr. President,  The  pandemic  has  challenged  ruthlessly  the  world  economies,  their  liquidity  and resilience more than ever. Estimates indicate that in 2020, the virus reduced global economic growth  by  .  percent,  global  trade  fallen  by  .  percent,  however  the  global  economy  is projected to experience recovery in 2021.     During the pandemic, information technology was the main engine of social life and has proved firmly its role and position in the life of the 21st century. Prior to the COVID-, the use of information technology was deeply ingrained in economic, business and financial relations, but  during  the  pandemic,  remote  diagnostics  and  treatment,  e-learning,  and  home-based working were expanding and bringing new forms of labor organization.  Over the past two years, we learned that isolation from society and loneliness are more fearful  than  the  coronavirus  itself,  at  a  time  when  humanity  is  increasingly  in  need  of socialization.  We  also  witnessed  that  aparting  from  live  communications  between  family members,  friends,  children,  colleagues  and  between  states  and  nations  negatively  impacts businesses, education, social behavior and relations, and mental health.  It is worth noting that if we accept the challenges facing the world as opportunities  to save  resources,  time  and  space,  we  will  be  able  to  adapt  and  recover  faster  in  this  new environment. Mr. President, The year of 2021 marks the centennial anniversary of the People's Revolution and the 60th anniversary of Mongolia’s full-fledged membership to the United Nations.  As a result of the People's Revolution of 1921, in Mongolia, the monarchy was abolished and  consequently, the  First Constitution  was  adopted, and  a  republic  proclaimed.  However, membership  in  the  UNin  1961  served  as  an  additional  guarantee  of  our  independence  and sovereignty,  and  we  became  a  full-pledged  member  of  the  world  community.  Hence,  we consider this anniversary as an important event in the national history and are marking it in a broad echelon.  We, Mongolians, view the United Nations, as an organization for peace and security, human rights and development of nations in five continents, and as a faithful companion of the past  years and a reliable partner of many more  years ahead us.  Mongolians say that  “a person with friends lives in a wide space like a steppe and a person without friends lives in a tight space like a palm”. Nowadays, Mongolia has diplomatic relations with 193 countries of the world and became a member of more than  international and intergovernmental organizations. Moreover, we deem that the fact of Mongolia’s accession to  more  than  290  international  treaties  is  a  proof  of  our  increasing  position,  roles,  and responsibilities at international arena and global affairs.     The  UN  system  organizations  have  made  a  significant  contribution  to  Mongolia’s development.  In  particular,  we  have  cooperated  fruitfully  in  different  fields,  including strengthening  democracy  and  good  governance,  improving  the  legal  environment,  ensuring human  rights,  reducing  poverty,  protecting  maternal  and  child  health,  and  promoting  the environmental and sustainable development. On behalf of the people of Mongolia, I wish to convey my sincere gratitude to the UN and its system organizations for rendering a multifaceted assistance and creating groups of      donors  and  supporters  throughout  the  challenging  times  of  our  country,  such  as  social  and economic  transition  in  the  1990-ies,  the  repeated  winter  calamities  and  the  COVID- pandemic.        Mr. President,  For  the  last    years,  Mongolia  has  been  actively  engaged  and  contributed  to  the achievement of the objectives and principles of the UN Charter. My country has initiated and tabled more than  UN General Assembly resolutions on nearly  agenda items, including Disarmament  Week,  the  Declaration  on  the  Right  to  Peace,  nuclear-weapon-free  status, economic  development,  environmental  protection,  cooperatives,  situation  of  women  in  rural areas, literacy and education for democracy.  Amongst  them,  Mongolia  declared  its  territory  as  a  nuclear-weapon-free  in 1992  and has been working actively in this direction ever since.  Furthermore, I would like to emphasize the facts that we have been actively participating in the UN peacekeeping operations since 2002,  the period of 2003-2012 was proclaimed as the UN Literacy Decade at the initiative of Mongolia and the International Think-Tank, the first ever intergovernmental body for Landlocked Developing Countries, has been established  in Ulaanbaatar.   As  we  continue  the  work  to  ensure  the  special  needs  and  interests  of  landlocked developing  countries,  based  upon  the  advantage  of  our  geographical  location,  we  strive  to develop into “Transit Mongolia”, a transit, trade and service hub connecting Asia and Europe.  Taking this opportunity, I would also like to underscore that Mongolia is committed to participating  in  economic  integration  in  the  Asia-Pacific  region,  such  as  becoming  ASEAN Dialogue Partner as well as joining East Asia Summit and APEC. Mr. President,  The coronavirus pandemic is the major disaster since the World War II. Although 103 years have passed since the World War I and  years since the World War II, the dangers of the war have not yet been fully eliminated, and the attempts to resolve issues by military means  persist to this day. Therefore, in today's world, this horrendous phenomenon called war must be completely eliminated  from  the  future  of  mankind  and  human  propriety,  and  the  role  and  pertinence  of resolving any conflicts and misunderstandings only through peaceful means and dialogue as well as promoting preventive diplomacy are on the rise. There is a widespread misconception that our ancestor  Chinggis Khan was a vicious man  who  conquered  many  nations.  However,  world  history  and  studies  show  that  he  was adherent  of  diplomacy,  and  he  was  a  peacemaker  with  true  desire  to  set  borders  without hostilities.      His dream was realized through a solid peace that lasted for almost 200 years on the  great chessboard of Eurasia and world scholars call this period ""Pax Mongolica"" which made a noteworthy contribution to the development of humankind. We, Mongolians, have inherited this  spirit  of  cherishing  peace  from  our  ancestors,  and  today,  Mongolia  is  internationally recognized as a peace-loving democratic nation. In 1990, we were able to peacefully transit to the democratic system without a single gunfire. We have no territorial or border disputes with our neighbors. We have no religious or ethnic conflicts. Mongolia is a country that pursues peaceful, open, independent and multi-pillar foreign policy.  Therefore, with a view to build an intellectual immunity against war in human beings, we present  an  initiative  to  observe  September  ,  the  day,  when  devastating  World  War  II,  that involved  more  than  100  million  people  from  more  than    countries  and  took  the  lives  of millions, had ended, as international day to commemorate “Humanity’s Victory Over War"". We are confident that countries and peoples of the world will support this initiative.  We see emerging military, political, and security-related issues, increasing number of armed  conflicts  associated  to  religion,  cultural  difference,  economic  competition  and globalization, growing flow of refugees as well as environmental degradation. Accordingly, the UN political and peacekeeping operations policy, its type and scope have been modified.   We support efforts to increase peacekeepers’ role and change in the requirement for them as well as the desire to take immediate action with a compact force equipped with modern weapons, equipment and facilities in line with the relevant mission’s operational situation. Since  2002  Mongolia  has  deployed  nearly    thousand  Blue  Helmets  to    UN peacekeeping operations in three different continents and ranks high in the world in terms of per  capita  deployment  of  peacekeepers  and  number  of  military  personnel.  In  the  future, Mongolia aims to increase its participation in the UN peacekeeping operations and is preparing to deploy Quick Reaction Force Company, Construction Engineering Company, and Level Two Hospital to the UN missions. Moreover, Mongolia pursues a policy to increase percentage of women peacekeepers to  percent in accordance with the UN Security Council Resolution on Women, Peace and Security. In that regard, Mongolia will host an international conference on participation of female peacekeepers in the UN PKOs next year in Ulaanbaatar.  We call on the Department of Peace Operations and Member States to support and cooperate in organizing this conference.  Mr. President,  Even though the pandemic and vaccination would remain major concerns in the near future, we should not overlook the matters of future progress and sustainable development.      In  line  with  the  global  development  trend  and  the  Sustainable  Development  Agenda 2030, the State Great Khural (Parliament) of Mongolia adopted the “Vision 2050”, Mongolia’s long-term development policy.   Due to the COVID-, my country’s economy, which had been growing steadily in the three years prior to the pandemic, contracted by . percent in 2020.  Nevertheless, due to the step-by-step measures taken by the Government to support the domestic economy and the favorable external economic environment, Mongolia’s economy is expected to recover and grow by an average of . percent in 2021-2022.  International  financial  organizations  have  emphasized  that  budgetary  and  fiscal measures taken by the Government of Mongolia to protect its economy from the pandemic are higher than those of some developed countries compared to its economic capacity.  Moreover,  major  banking  and  financial  institutions,  such  as  the  World  Bank  and  the Asian  Development  Bank,  have  repeatedly  highlighted  that  Mongolia  has  been  particularly effective in protecting incomes of the low-and-middle income people and preventing them from falling into poverty.   Mongolia’s economy, dominated by agriculture and mining, remains vulnerable to any risk  and  disaster.  In  the  aftermath  of  the  pandemic,  we  are  planning  to  focus  on  structural reforms, economic diversification, investment promotion,  maintenance of fiscal and financial stability to create environmentally friendly, sustainable and inclusive economic growth. Foreign direct investment will continue to play a key role in developing countries during and  after  the  pandemic.  Creating  a  favorable  business  environment  and  promoting  foreign direct investment will remain a fundamental goal in the economy of Mongolia. We  look  forward  to  working  more  actively  with  foreign  and  domestic  investors, businesses than ever before on mutually beneficial basis. In doing so, we will comply with the principles of respect for the environment and protecting the traditional way of life from negative impact. We also attach great importance to intensifying governance reform at all levels of the public and private sectors and reducing corruption including through e-transition which is the most realistic mechanism to ensure transparency, accountability, effective service, and good governance.  Mongolia  aims  to  transfer  at  least    percent  of  all  public  services  available  on  the integrated “E-Mongolia” system and strives to become a “Digital Nation” for 2021-2024.  Mr. President,  Climate change is having a devastating effect for the past decades. Proper diagnosis of the causes is key to overcome its harmful effects. One of the causes of adverse climate change is oblivious human activity. It is the result of our own careless behavior toward the nature and environment. Humans have been largely debating  over ethical conduct towards each other,     but not towards the mother nature which has led to the current environmental and ecological disasters. During the pandemic lockdown, we witnessed certain signs of natural self-recovery, at least  for  a  short  period  of  time,  such  as  quick  recovery  of  the  ozone  layer,  reduction  of  air pollution,  purification  of  rivers  and  waters  and  revival  of  the  fauna  and  flora.  This  is  the showcase that we need to change the behavior and attitude of humanity toward the nature and make tangible efforts to induce positive results. This also evidenced by the fact that the frequency and  scope of wildfires, hurricanes, floods,  droughts  and  dzuds  are  increasing  every  year,  causing  devastating  damages  in  all corners of the world. From ancient times, we, Mongolians, have honored the eternal blue sky as “father” and the land as “mother”, worshipped the surrounding mountains and waters with deep love and respect and been recharged by their vital energy.  Our ancestors thoroughly followed and delicately discovered the nature’s demeanor in a  way  that  allowed  them  to  process  and  use  animal-derived  products  and  food  in  both environmentally- and human health-friendly ways. We used the earth’s blessings such as trees, water, animal and other natural resources, only according to our own or household needs, and saving resources for the next generations.  The  natural  self-recovery  reminds  me  of  the  nomadic  know-how  of  leaving  the pastureland “fallow” or “leaving the pastureland for rest”. This is a Mongolian herders’ wisdom to offer to the motherland an opportunity to rest a while and to recover and revive itself.  In our fight against climate change, let us draw lessons from the Mongolian traditional “nomadic  civilization”  to  treat  and  regard  the  nature  respectfully  and  combine  it  with achievements  of  modern  science  and  technology  as  well  as  best  practices  and  traditional experiences from all over the world.  Desertification that is threatening the livelihoods of more than two billion people in the world and the sand storm originating from Mongolia are becoming major problems for us. Currently,  a  big  portion  of  Mongolian  territory  is  affected  by  desertification  or  land degradation to certain degree. Main reasons are .C increase of the mean temperature and  percent decline in annual precipitation level for the last  plus years. The  most  efficient  way  to  reverse  desertification  is  planting  trees.  We,  Mongolians, ponder  that  planting  trees,  writing  books  and  raising  children  are  the  three  superior  deeds. Hence, we have launched a campaign to plant billions of trees by 2030 from this podium of the General Assembly in order to contribute to the global fight against climate change. Climate  change  and  ecosystem  degradation  pose  a  real  threat  to  the  future  of humankind  irrespective  of  borders  or  ethnicity.  Conscious  of  this  critical  turning  point,  the countries around the globe have decided to gather in Glasgow in November for the COP26 (Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change).    I urge you, my fellow leaders, to increase and renew your respective contributions and pledges on fostering green development, reducing Greenhouse gas emissions and developing environmentally friendly society and economy. Mr. President, The  key  approach to  a swift recovery the pandemic and restoration of our blue planet is our close cooperation, mutual understanding and assistance, as well as commitment to continue and intensify implementation of the internationally agreed  development  goals, such  as the  Sustainable  Development  Agenda  2030,  the  Addis  Ababa Action Agenda,  the  Paris  Agreement  on  Climate  Change  and  the  Sendai  Framework  for Disaster Risk Reduction. the damages of from Last  month,  the  Summer  Olympic Games,  symbol  of  peace  and  unity of humankind, was successfully organized in Tokyo, allowing athletes from five continents to gather together. Unlike  the  General Debate of  the last 75th  session  of the  UN  General  Assembly,  where  the heads of delegations spoke virtually, this year, we are meeting in person here in the General Assembly Hall and are able to greet each other warmly. These developments give us hope that the threat of the pandemic is slowing down and we will surmount it eventually. May the eternal blue sky bless us - the humanity. Thank you for your attention.               "
50,2021,KOR,Republic of Korea,"President Abdulla Shahid,   Secretary General Ant  ni Guterres,   Distinguished delegates,   Standing  befre  yu  again  in  tw  years  at  the  United  Natins  General  Assembly,  I  am keenly reminded f the precius nrmal daily lives that had been lst.             Guided  by  the  leadership  f  President  Shahid  wh  assumed  presidency  f  the  76th sessin  f  the  UNGA,  I  hpe  the  internatinal  cmmunity  will  gather  its  wisdm  and wrk in cllabratin t tackle glbal crises.   Fr the past  years, Secretary General Guterres has wrked tirelessly t revitalize and refrm the UN, and I ffer my sincere cngratulatins and respect t yu, Mr. Secretary-General, fr yur re-electin victry.   I am mst certain that yu will make greater strides in the key agenda dearest t yur heart such as peacekeeping peratins, climate respnse and SDGs.   I hpe that the UNGA sessin this year will impart t the peple f the wrld a message f hpe that we will emerge victrius frm the pandemic and climate crisis and attain sustainable develpment.   Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General and Distinguished Delegates,   Humans, by nature, build and live tgether in cmmunities.   Resrting  t  cllective  intellect  and  mutual  aid  available  in  thse  cmmunities, humanity has prevailed ver a myriad f infectius diseases and lived in c-existence.     The Cvid- pandemic will als be surmunted by the lve f humanity and slidarity, and at its heart, the UN shall stand.   In  ur  fight  against  crnavirus,  brders  were  crssed  t  share  genmic  infrmatin; vaccines  were  successfully  launched  thrugh  clse  cllabratin;  and  therapeutics  are als being develped at a rapid pace.     A triumph ver crnavirus demands us t break dwn barriers.   The  hrizns  f  ur  lives  and  thughts  have  extended  frm  villages  t  cuntries,  and frm cuntries t the entire planet.         This, I reckn, is the cming f an era f glbal cmmunity. In this era f glbal cmmunity, we emply ne anther and wrk with ne anther. We gather ur wisdm tgether and we act tgether.     T date, cuntries with advanced ecnmy and mre pwer have taken the lead in the wrld.  Yet,  frm  nw,  all  natins  are  called  upn  t  mve  in  tandem  with  their  best pssible gals and best pssible appraches in pursuing sustainable develpment.     As the pivt f such cperatin and actin, the UN will be asked t take n a larger rle than nw.   Funders  f  the  UN,  having  gne  thrugh  the  scurge  f  tw  wrld  wars,  aspired  t establish an rder fr internatinal peace.   Nw, the UN is requested t recmmend a new set f rules and gals as it ushers in this era f glbal cmmunity.     T facilitate mutually beneficial cperatin within the framewrk f multilateral rder, the UN must becme an institutin that builds trust amng natins.   An  institutin  that brings tgether the  cmmitment  and capabilities f the  cmmunity f natins t galvanize actin.   The Republic f Krea will take an active part in the internatinal rder f slidarity and cperatin t be led by the UN.     Krea, a newly independent state after Wrld War II, was able t build a demcracy and a strng ecnmy with the supprt f the UN and the internatinal cmmunity.   Nw a respnsible member f the internatinal cmmunity, Krea is determined t step up its effrts t help cuntries prsper tgether and embrace ne anther.     Krea will take the lead in putting frward a visin fr partnership and c-existence that can be shared by bth develped and develping cuntries.     A task mst urgent fr the glbal cmmunity is delivering an inclusive recvery frm the crnavirus crisis.   Lw-incme  families,  the  elderly  and  ther  vulnerable  grups  were  left  mst  widely expsed t the threat f crnavirus.   Sciecnmic  prblems  built  up  ver  the  years  were  brught  t  the  fre  by  the pandemic.   Pverty and hunger have deepened.     Frm incme, jbs t educatin, gaps widened acrss gender, class, and cuntries.      The UN has been calling fr reducing such inequalities already fr years by putting frth the Sustainable Develpment Gals fr 2030.   Nw, it is incumbent upn all members f the UN t wrk with greater vigr t realize the SDGs.     Krea  will  stand  tgether  t  help  all  peple  in  every  cuntry  live  withut  the  fear  f crnavirus.     We will deliver n ur 200-millin-dllar pledge t COVAX AMC.    As ne f the glbal vaccine prductin hubs, we will strive fr an equitable and expeditius supply f Cvid- vaccines.         Krea will als stand at the vanguard f the endeavrs t achieve the SDGs.   In a bid t defeat the pandemic and make a new leap frward, we are pushing frward the Krean New Deal plicy.   Ntably,  we  are  reinfrcing  emplyment  and  scial  safety  nets  and  expanding investment in peple under the  Human New  Deal t realize  an inclusive  recvery that puts peple first.   Our  plicy  experience  frm  the  Krean  New  Deal  will  be  shared  with  the  rest  f  the wrld.     T help develping cuntries advance clser twards SDGs tgether, Krea plans t scale up  its  ODA,  particularly  in  green,  digital,  and  healthcare  -  the  areas  that  have  seen  a surge in demand during the pandemic.   Anther  pressing  task  fr  the  glbal  cmmunity  t  undertake  is  respnding  t  the climate crisis.         Even as we speak, ur planet is getting htter faster than anticipated.         The cmmunity f natins must jin frces in clser cncert with ne anther t push frward carbn neutrality.         Last year, Krea cmmitted itself t carbn neutrality by 2050 and legislated its visin and implementatin framewrk by enacting the Framewrk Act n Carbn Neutrality.   By  next  mnth,  we  will  finalize  ur  2050  carbn  neutrality  scenari  and  unveil  ur enhanced 2030 NDC at COP  in Nvember.   We  have  shut  dwn  cal-fired  pwer  plants  earlier  than  scheduled  and  ended  public      financing fr new verseas cal-fired pwer generatin, with effrts underway t ramp up the generatin f new and renewable energy.   Carbn  neutrality  can  be  achieved  nly  when  each  and  every  cuntry  is  engaged  in cntinued cperatin.   Actin plans must be als sustainable. Thrugh  Green  New  Deal,  Krea  is  turning  its  carbn  neutrality  cmmitment  int pprtunities t cultivate new industries and create jbs.   Many  Krean  businesses  are  vluntarily  jining  the  RE100  Campaign  and  expanding their  investment  in  hydrgen  and  ther  new  and  renewable  energy,  while  pushing frward ESG management and carbn neutrality with greater frce.   The  gvernment,  fr  its  part,  will  firmly  back  up  the  private  sectr  in  technlgy develpment and investment.   Krea will scale up its climate ODA and set up a Green New Deal Trust Fund with a view t  supprting  the  wrk  f  Glbal  Green  Grwth  Institute  (GGGI)  and  share  its technlgies and capacity fr carbn neutrality.       We  will  stand  ready  t  help  develping  cuntries  build  their  capacity  t  tackle  the climate crisis.   Mrever, building n ur experience as the hst f the P4G Seul Summit in galvanizing the glbal cmmitment int climate actin, Krea seeks t hst COP28 in 2023.   We  aspire  t take  n  a mre  vigrus rle fr  the  faithful implementatin f the  Paris Agreement.   Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General and Distinguished Delegates,   The  mst  ardent  dream  f  the  glbal  cmmunity  is  creating  a  life  that  is  peaceful  and secure.   The  birth  f  the  UN  has  transfrmed  the  paradigm  f  internatinal  relatins  based  n cmpetitin and cnflict int the ne f cexistence and shared prsperity.   The  UN has endeavred t replace  the  incmplete  peace  maintained by the  balance  f pwer with sustainable peace grunded in cperatin, thereby prmting freedm fr entire humanity.   T ensure a cmplete, lasting peace will begin taking firm rt n the Krean Peninsula,      Krea remains fully cmmitted t ding its part.     Envisining  a  de-nuclearized,  c-prsperus  Krean  Peninsula,  the  gvernment  f  the Republic f Krea has steadily carried frward the Krean Peninsula peace prcess, and amid  the  supprt  f  the  internatinal  cmmunity,  achieved  histric  milestnes  –  the Panmunjem Declaratin, Pyngyang Jint Declaratin f September 2018 and military agreement resulting frm the inter-Krean Summit, as well as the Singapre Declaratin frm the US-Nrth Krea Summit.   Peace n the Krean Peninsula begins always with dialgue and cperatin.     I  call  fr  speedy  resumptin  f  dialgue  between  the  tw  Kreas  and  between  the United States and Nrth Krea.   I  hpe  t  see  that  the  Krean  Peninsula  will  prve  the  pwer  f  dialgue  and cperatin in fstering peace.   Tw  years  ag  in  this  very  place,  I  declared  zer  tlerance  fr  war,  mutual  security guarantee  and  c-prsperity  as  the  three  principles  in  reslving  issues  related  t  the Krean Peninsula.   Last year, I prpsed a declaratin t ending the War n the Krean Peninsula. Mre than anything, an end-f-war declaratin will mark a pivtal pint f departure in creating a new rder f ‘recnciliatin and cperatin’ n the Krean Peninsula.   Tday, I nce again urge the cmmunity f natins t mbilize its strengths fr the end-f-war  declaratin  n  the  Krean  Peninsula  and  prpse  that  three  parties  f  the  tw Kreas and the  US, r fur parties f the  tw  Kreas, the  US and China cme  tgether and declare that the War n the Krean Peninsula is ver. When the parties invlved in the Krean War stand tgether and prclaim an end t the War, I believe we can make irreversible prgress in denuclearizatin and usher in an era f cmplete peace. In fact, this year marks a meaningful 30th anniversary f the simultaneus admissin f Suth and Nrth Krea int the United Natins.   With the jint accessin t the UN, the tw Kreas bth recgnized that they were tw separate natins different in systems and idelgies.   Hwever, such was never meant t perpetuate the divisin. Fr when we acknwledged and respected each ther, nly then culd we set ut n a    path t exchange, recnciliatin, and unificatin.   When the tw Kreas and the surrunding natins wrk tgether, peace will be firmly established  n  the  Krean  Peninsula  and  prsperity  fstered  acrss  entire  Nrtheast Asia.     That  will  g  dwn  as  a  Krean  Peninsula  Mdel  in  which  peace  is  attained  thrugh cperatin.   Nrth Krea, fr its part, must brace fr changes that befit the era f glbal cmmunity.   I  expect  that  the  internatinal  cmmunity,  tgether  with  Krea,  remain  always  ready and willing t reach ut t Nrth Krea in a cperative spirit.   Heeding the yearnings f the separated families, already advanced in age, we must lse n time in pressing ahead with their reunins.     When  Suth  and  Nrth  Krea  are  engaged  tgether  in  reginal  platfrms  such  as  the Nrtheast Asia Cperatin fr Health Security, a mre effective respnse t infectius diseases and natural disasters will becme feasible. As  a  cmmunity  bund  by  cmmn  destiny  n  the  Krean  Peninsula,  and  as  the members  f  the  glbal  cmmunity,  the  Suth and  Nrth,  I  hpe,  will cme  tgether  t jin frces.     Twards building a Krean Peninsula that prmtes shared prsperity and cperatin, I will make ceaseless effrts until my very last day in ffice. The recent situatin in Afghanistan serves as a stark reminder f the crucial rle that the UN plays in advancing peace and human rights.   Cming December, the UN Peacekeeping Ministerial will be hsted in Krea. T ensure  safer and mre  effective  peratin f UN peacekeeping missins, Krea will make  use  f  this  pprtunity  t  encurage  clser  cperatin  in  the  internatinal cmmunity.       Fr the UN’s initiatives in cnflict preventin and peacebuilding, Krea t will increase its fair share f cntributin.   Krea will make a bid fr a seat as a nn-permanent member f the UN Security Cuncil fr  the  cming  2024-2025  term,  and  t  build  sustainable  peace  and  thriving  future generatins, it stands ready t play an active part. I lk frward t yur cperatin and supprt in this regard.   Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General and Distinguished Delegates,        Humanity, even in the darkest hurs f adversity, has never lst hpe fr the future.

51,2021,BRN,Brunei Darussalam,"President, Mr. Secretary-General, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, Assalamualaikum  warahmatullahi  wabarakatuh  and  Peace  Be Upon You All Let me at the outset, convey the warm greetings of His Majesty the  Sultan  and  Yang  Di-Pertuan  of  Brunei  Darussalam  to  this august assembly. I would also like to congratulate His Excellency Abdulla Shahid on assuming the Presidency of the Seventy-Sixth Session of the General Assembly, and wish him much success in his new role.  I wish to also congratulate Secretary-General, Antnio Guterres on his re-appointment.  This serves as a testament of Member States’  confidence  towards  his  able  leadership,  and  I  welcome his  continued  dedication  and  commitment  towards  serving  the international community.   Mr. President, For more than  months, Brunei Darussalam, and the rest of the world,  continues  to  face  the  challenges  of  the  COVID- pandemic.  After  a  year  of  being  free  of  local  transmissions, Brunei Darussalam now faced another wave of the pandemic.             In our efforts to control the spread of the virus and its variants, the Government of His Majesty has swiftly implemented several including  restricted to  other  countries, measures,  similar movements  and  international  travel  as  well  as  ramping  up vaccination efforts.  Although our experience is one of many that demonstrates the need  to  remain  vigilant,  it  is  still  vaccinations  that  is  key  to controlling the spread and ensure the safety of our people.  However,  the  current  global  system  of  vaccine  distribution remains to be of much concern. Although over . billion doses of  vaccines  have  been  distributed  globally,  %  of  these vaccines  only  go  to    countries.  On  top  of  that,  low-income countries  are  only  able  to  vaccinate  less  than  %  of  their population.   It is therefore urgent for  Members States to work together  with pharmaceutical  companies  to  ensure  that  COVAX  are  able  to fulfil its commitments to supply and deliver equitable, accessible and affordable vaccines for all. The message of the Secretary General rings true – no one is safe until everyone is safe. As we recover from the pandemic, another long-term challenge that is emerging due to repeated lockdowns and quarantines, is the issue of mental health.  If remain unaddressed, our next generation of workforce and the generation after that will be greatly affected, ultimately resulting in  the  slow  down  of  the  global  economy  and  developmental progress.          In  this  regard,  we  welcome  the  inclusion  of  an  indicator  on preparedness  for  providing  mental  health  and  psychosocial support during emergencies in the Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan by the World Health Assembly.  In our region, Brunei Darussalam is working closely with Australia and  Malaysia  in  adopting  the  East  Asia  Leaders  Statement  on Mental  Health  Cooperation  in  October  at  the  16th  East  Asia Summit.  This  will  help  strengthen  regional  efforts  towards  addressing mental  health,  and  encourage  other  member  states  to  take concrete collective action in promoting better mental health in the region. At  the  crux  of  it  all,  the  people’s  health  and  well-being  are fundamental to build back better and stronger towards a resilient global community.  Mr. President, In  addressing  the  adverse  impacts  of  the  pandemic,  it  has  not only compromised ongoing national development plans but also the  resources  of  many  countries,  notably  the  small  developing states, and recently there have been reports that the effects of the pandemic will inevitably delay progress towards achieving the 2030 Agenda. In this regard, we must ensure that our recovery efforts prioritise the  recovery  of  our  economies  by  ramping  up  trade  and investments  so  that  livelihoods  and  employment  can  recover quickly.              This means we must continue to uphold free and open trade and investments, encourage greater technological collaboration and transfer, as well as strengthen global developmental cooperation to ensure no country is left behind.  In pursuing our recovery plans from the pandemic, it is also timely for us to incorporate green initiatives.  the  pandemic,  and This is because the threat of climate change continues to exist the during Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report is not positive at all.  forecast  of recent the We already made commitments under the Paris Agreement, and all that remains is for us to uphold and implement them.  In this important ‘climate year’, we welcome the UK’s Presidency and hosting of the COP26, and their calls for the world to come together, deliver, and raise climate ambitions where possible. We look forward to a meaningful outcome at the COP26 in Glasgow, that  would  set  the  tone  and  direction  for  global  efforts  in  the future.  In  our  region,  we  are  launching  the  ASEAN  Framework  for Circular  Economy  to  close  the  loop  on  finite  resource  wastage while enhancing economic growth and reducing pressure on the environment.   Mr. President,  ASEAN, under the Chairmanship of Brunei Darussalam this year, with the theme – We Care, We Prepare, We Prosper – intends to make good on the promise of building resilience through hope.           The  alignment  with  the  General  Assembly’s  theme  shows  the importance  of  ensuring  that  there  is  hope  for  our  people  and planet in the future. Our  ASEAN  deliverables  also  demonstrate  our  commitment  to maintaining regional peace and security. This  is  why  this  year,  when  the  situation  in  one  of  our  fellow ASEAN  family  member  could  affect  the  stability  of  the  region, ASEAN  Leaders  quickly  met  and  agreed  on  the  Five-Point Consensus  to  ensure  a  peaceful  return  to  democracy  in  that member state in accordance to the will and interests of its people.  The  Five-Point  Consensus,  among  others,  also  calls  for  an the immediate  cessation  of  violence  as  well  as commencement of dialogue among all parties concerned and to allow for the provision of humanitarian assistance. for To  this  end,  on  behalf  of  ASEAN,  I  would  like  to  express  our deepest gratitude to our external partners, including the United Nations, for  the  generous contributions accorded at the Humanitarian Pledging Conference last month. for  their  assistance  and  also We  welcome community in ASEAN’s efforts. the  continued  support  of the international Mr. President, The question of Palestine remains very much in our thoughts for over  seven  decades.  Up  until  now,  there  has  not  been  any concrete resolution.            We  continue  to  see  forced  eviction,  destruction  of  homes  and expansion  of  illegal  settlements  by  the  Occupying  Power.  This has not only deprived the Palestinians of their basic human rights but also have denied them of any chance for their right to self-determination.  The UN Security Council has a special responsibility to call for cessation  of  all  violence,  and  fulfil  its  obligations  of  upholding international  peace  and  work  towards  finding  a  comprehensive and lasting peace on the basis of the two-state solution.  We also call on the international community to remain resolute in their commitment to safeguarding the two-state solution towards achieving  an  independent  state  of  Palestine  based  on  the  pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. Mr. President,  Brunei  Darussalam  stands  here  today  to  reiterate  our  support and commitment to preserving international peace and security, promote  prosperity  and  sustainable  development,  underpinned by the adherence to international obligations and rule of law, as enshrined in the UN Charter.  Let us move forward in this new normal, with the renewed spirit of  upholding  multilateralism  and  continued  hope  to  achieve international peace, prosperity and security for all of our people.  Thank you.  *****         "
52,2021,KHM,Cambodia,"President, Mr. Secretary General, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, At the outset, let me express my heartfelt appreciation to Excellency Volkan Bozkir for his past efforts to guide the work of the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly. I wish to congratulate as well Excellency Abdulla Shahid for his election as the President of the  76th  UNGA  Session.  I  also  have  the  great  pleasure  to  congratulate  His  Excellency Antonio  Guterres  for  his  second  term  reappointment  as  the  United  Nations  Secretary-General. This is the second time that the UNGA has to hold its session in a virtual setting due to the COVID- pandemic. COVID- and the surge of its variants are the biggest challenge and the  most  disruptive  event  in modern history. Overcoming the  COVID-   pandemic and efforts to restore growth have been the top priority for all countries. Cambodia has joined international efforts to rollout a widespread vaccination campaign. Our National Campaign was  launched  on    February  2021,  and  we  have  made  steady  progress,  including  the vaccination of foreign nationals, children, and youth between  to  years of age. At this rate, we expect to vaccinate around % ( million people) of the total population (of around  million) by no later than November of this year. With good vaccination progress in combination with strong containment and treatment measures, Cambodia looks ahead to a gradual re-opening of a sustainable and inclusive social and economic activity. We take this opportunity to express our sincere thanks to all our bilateral and multilateral friends for the generous support extended to Cambodia in our fight against COVID-. Mr. President, Our world  still  has to tackle  a  myriad of other  pressing  challenges such as  geo-political competition and rivalries between major powers, technological and trade wars, territorial armed conflicts, terrorism and transnational crimes, and Climate Change. The pressure on international peace and security is as great as ever. History has told us time and again that interference and worse, military options to impose different systems of governance are not the solutions. Far from it, they have only led to many more deaths, human suffering and misery, social and economic strife. Cambodia is the  real-life  example  and  has  experienced  the  worst  tragedy;  and  sadly,  we  are  now     witnessing  the  repetition  of  the  same  policies.  If  the  recent  events  in  Afghanistan,  and many  more  before  it,  are  lessons  to  be  learnt  from,  there  is  great  merit  to  respect  the wishes of each nation and their people’s rights to self- determination. That  is  why  there  is  now  a  compelling  reason  to  strengthen  multilateralism  and  rules- based international cooperation. Countries, large and small, differ in their history, culture, traditions,  ways  of  life  and  political  organization.  They  should  not  be  hindered  by  the imposition of unilateral sanctions, embargoes or other coercive economic measures that violate international law and the very principles enshrined in  the  Charter  of  the  United Nations. Mr. President, This coming November, Cambodia is proud to host virtually the 13th Summit of the Asia-Europe  Meeting  (ASEM13)  with  a  theme  “Strengthening  multilateralism  for  shared growth” that we view today as still very important. In my view, the main agenda that must dominate  the  Summit  should  be  that  multilateralism  gives  priority  to  convergences:  a convergence  on  the  fight  against  COVID-  and  to  build  back  a  stronger  society  and economy; a convergence on the fight against climate change and on key proposals for WTO reform, amongst others. Climate change is another impending challenge that requires urgent and concrete global actions at all levels. In this context, Cambodia supports the Secretary-General’s call to scale up support for regional adaptation and mitigation efforts and reaffirm our commitment to the  Paris  Agreement,  in  line  with  the  principle  of  common  but  differentiated responsibilities. Mr. President, International  peace  and  security  are  of  utmost  importance  for  a  sustainable  future. Cambodia would like to reiterate its longstanding position that the primary responsibility for  the  maintenance  of  international  peace  and  security  rests  with  the  United  Nations. Since  2006,  Cambodia  has  contributed  more  than  ,500  troops  to  serve  in  various  UN peacekeeping  missions  across  the  globe,  and  a  number  of  our  troops  have  made  the ultimate  sacrifice  during  their  mission  to  protect  the  innocents.  Moreover,  Cambodia supports  the  Secretary-General’s  Action  for  Peacekeeping  Plus  (A4P+)  initiative. Cambodia also supports the  Women, Peace  and Security (WPS) Agenda  which will help integrate a meaningful gender perspective in various peacekeeping operations. In addition, I would like to emphasize that the changing realities of the twenty-first century demand a newly revamped and responsive United Nations. The organization requires a   more democratic, inclusive, and representative approach to the problems of the day. In this light, Cambodia fully supports the Secretary-General’s proactive efforts to make the organization nimbler and responsive to the needs of its Member States. The relationship between the Security Council, the General Assembly, and the United Nations Secretariat must also be reinvigorated. In this regard, Cambodia wishes to reaffirm its support for the Security Council reform. We are of the view that the foremost priority should be given to increasing the representation of developing countries which comprise the vast majority of Member States. Mr. President, As  the  incoming  chair  of  ASEAN  next  year,  Cambodia  will  seek  to  address  the  common challenges facing our region. With a strong solidarity from ASEAN Member States and the support  of  its  external  partners,  Cambodia  will  aim  to  further  advance  the  ASEAN Community building process and to sustain ASEAN as a region of critical importance for global trade, investment, and supply chains. Cambodia will continue to push for a more vibrant and harmonious ASEAN Community with better protection of migrant workers, a greener  and  more  inclusive  development  agenda,  and  a  more  advanced  digital transformation for MSMEs, women and youth entrepreneurship. May I conclude by expressing my strong hope for a strengthened multilateralism with the United Nations at the core to galvanize international solidarity for the global community to succeed in overcoming the COVID- crisis, advancing peace, sustainable development, and shared prosperity for all. Multilateralism is our hope, and we look to the UN as our “beacon of hope”. I thank you for your kind attention. ******      "

54,2021,MYS,Malaysia,"President,  Mr. Secretary-General,  Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,  Introduction  I join others in congratulating you, Mr. President, on your election as President of the 76th Session of the UN General Assembly.   I would also like to thank His Excellency Mr. Volkan Bozkir . for his dedication and leadership in successfully completing the work  of  the  last  session,  which  was  done  under  difficult circumstances due to the prevailing COVID- pandemic.  .  Malaysia  welcomes  the  theme  of  this  year’s  General Assembly – “Building resilience through hope – to recover from COVID-,  rebuild  sustainably,  respond  to  the  needs  of  the planet,  respect  the  rights  of  people,  and  revitalise  the  United Nations”. The theme serves as a stark reminder of what needs to be done and the long road we have before us.  Mr. President,  .  Malaysia is fully  committed in managing, overcoming and recovering  from  this  deadly  pandemic.    No  one  is  safe  unless everyone  is  safe.    We  must  fight  this  battle  together.    Our common  mission  in  these  unprecedented  times  call  us  to recognize that humankind is one big extended family.  It is in that spirit  that  we  in  Malaysia  have  very  consciously  referred  to ourselves as ‘Keluarga Malaysia’.  Together, and putting aside our  differences,  we  will  protect  lives  and  livelihoods.  We  will ensure that Malaysia will not only bounce back but will thrive as the world emerges from the depths of the pandemic.                  .  But,  Mr.  President,  I  am  not  here  to  only  speak  about Malaysia. I am here to call for us to work together in the spirit of a  “world  family”,  to  address  the  deep-rooted  challenges  of inequality, political instability and global governance.   COVID- and Health Diplomacy  Last year, the international community came together with . a  pledge  to  fight  COVID-  hand-in-hand.    With  our  unified commitment; with the aggressive rollout of vaccines; and,  with the sharing and adoption of best practices, we should have been on our way to recovery.  Sadly, the reality today is that we are far from winning the war against this deadly virus.   .  Our relief that vaccines were developed in record time was quickly  followed  by  distress  at  its  discriminatory  rollout.    While most vaccine producing nations as well as those that have the financial means have achieved some measure of success, the majority  of  the  world’s  population,  mainly  from  middle  income and least developed countries, remain unvaccinated.  .  Nevertheless,  our  focus  should  not  just  be  on  vaccines. There  are  other  aspects  of  health  that  require  our  attention. Many health challenges transcend national borders. COVID- is  just  the  latest  challenge  besetting  us.  Before  that,  the to  deal  with  other  serious international  community  had outbreaks, which had their unique security and socio-economic dimensions.                     .  With  the  growing  frequency  of  global  health  threats,  this world family must come together and engage in more effective health diplomacy. We must ensure greater collaboration not just to  end  this  pandemic  but  on  an  array  of  other  health-related issues.  These  include  expanding  the  public  health  capacity  of nations,  particularly  by  enhancing  their  access  to  relevant technology and knowledge.  .  We  truly  need  to  regard  public  health  as  a  global  public good rather than the exclusive domain of individual nations. It is because of this that Malaysia will play a more prominent role and participate more actively in health diplomacy, and our approach will be more inter-disciplinary in nature and involve more relevant stakeholders.  .  As  for  COVID-,  we  cannot  afford  to  wait  for  an  even deadlier variant to emerge and claim more lives. We need to act now.  Growing inequities and achieving the SDGs  Mr. President,  .  The  path  towards  achieving  the  UN  2030  Agenda  for Sustainable Development was never easy to begin with.  Yet, we have made steady progress.  COVID- has, however, reversed many hard-won gains.  The pandemic has amplified pre-existing inequalities and uncertainties.  It has widened the gap between the “haves and the have-nots"".  Varying degrees of shortfalls in governance  and  social  security  have  driven  populations  back into  poverty.    Needless  to  say,  we  are  further  away  from achieving the 2030 Agenda now than we were before.                  .  Like the rest of the world, Malaysia’s economy has not been spared.  In  2020,  Malaysia’s  GDP  contracted  by  .%.    This marks the worst decline in more than  years since the Asian Financial Crisis.   .  From  the  beginning  of  the  pandemic,  Malaysia  took  a whole-of-government  and  whole-of-society  approach in addressing  this  unprecedented  crisis.    We  executed  a  clear strategy  which  focused  on  three  thrusts.  Firstly,  we  expanded our healthcare delivery system to prevent the spread and tend to the infected; secondly, we provided strategic fiscal injections to safeguard the economy; and, thirdly, we protected the people’s livelihood.    In  doing  so,  we  introduced  economic  stimulus  packages . worth about USD130 billion or % of our  GDP.   We  ensured inclusive growth by addressing poverty, while providing a social safety  net  to  protect  vulnerable  groups.  These  packages  also play  an  important  role  in  assisting  enterprises  to  remain  afloat during these difficult times.   .  Almost  two  years  into  the  pandemic,  we  realise  that  we need  to  balance  between  keeping  our  people  safe  while protecting  their  livelihoods.    As  such,  Malaysia  introduced  the National  Recovery  Plan  as  the  nation’s  exit  strategy  from  the pandemic.  This includes speeding up vaccination rates, which stand at more than 500,000 doses daily in recent weeks.  It also includes reopening key economic sectors to revive the economy.  We  are  pleased  that  these  efforts  as  well  as  our  pursuit  in attaining  the  2030  Agenda  on  Sustainable  Development  were commended  during  our  Voluntary  National  Review  in  July  this year.              Climate Action  .  That  said,  rebuilding  lives  and  economies  after  the pandemic will not come easy. The challenges are even greater for  countries  that  are  more  vulnerable  to  natural  disasters.  Recovery efforts will certainly be more difficult and, thus, require more time and resources to take effect.    .  For  Malaysia,  mainstreaming  sustainability  is  key  in ensuring  a  smooth  transition  to  a  greener  socio-economic ecosystem.  We  have  set  ambitious  plans  to  facilitate  the transition  to  a  more  sustainable,  low-carbon,  and  climate-resilient  future.    We  have  introduced  policies  including  the concept  of  Circular  Economy,  which  will  drive  mitigation  and adaptation initiatives in our cities.  We are confident that they will greatly contribute towards making Malaysia a low carbon nation by 2050.  the  same time,  developed  countries  have the .  At responsibility  to  provide  financial  resources  and  technology transfer  to  the  developing  world  to  undertake  sustainable initiatives.  This is in line with the equity principle of ‘common but differentiated responsibility’.  Nuclear Disarmament   Mr. President,  .  The  development  and  deployment  of  nuclear  weapons continues to be a threat to all mankind.  Given the global health crisis,  we  find  it  disheartening  that  billions  of  dollars  are  being spent to maintain and modernise nuclear weapons, rather than on saving lives and livelihoods.                   .  Malaysia supports the total elimination of nuclear weapons and the assurance that they will never be produced again. This is  the  only  guarantee  against  the  catastrophic  consequences arising from their use.  Towards this end, Malaysia welcomes the coming  into  force  of  the  Treaty  on  the  Prohibition  of  Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) earlier this year.    .  Malaysia reaffirms its commitment to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation  of  Nuclear  Weapons  (NPT)  and  as  Chair  of  Main Committee  One  ()  on  Nuclear  Disarmament  for  the  10th  NPT Review Conference, we will strive towards bringing State Parties together and do our best to steer deliberations towards a fruitful outcome.  Peaceful Coexistence and Global Ceasefire  Mr. President,  .  Malaysia has always been a firm believer in all efforts and initiatives  that  promote  peaceful  coexistence  between  nations; between  different  peoples;  and,  between  different  faiths  and cultures.  .  As a multi-cultural, multi-racial and multi-religious country, Malaysia  strongly  believes  what  we  have  been  practicing  can also be applied to the entire world.  At the same time, we are a strong  proponent  of  multilateralism.    Both  multilateralism  and peaceful  coexistence  are  mutually  reinforcing.    We  need  to realise  that  as  we  progress  further,  we  should  be  far  more integrated and stronger as a family of nations.                      .  Respect and mutual understanding must be the backbone and essence in our interactions and discourse.  We believe that diversity  can  be  a  powerful  source  of  strength  and  resilience. Thus, we need to take a deeper look at the many qualities that make up our family of nations.   . It is no longer enough that we tolerate differences, but we should, instead, learn to celebrate and treat them with genuine curiosity and meaningful respect.  Amid the global uncertainties, it is time for us to work and strengthen our efforts towards living together in peace and harmony.  .  As  such,  Malaysia  will  continue  to  do  what  it  can  in promoting  peace  and  preventing  conflict  in  the  conduct  of  its foreign  policy.    With  this  approach,  Malaysia  will  continue  to uphold  its  fundamental  principles  of  defending  the  nation’s sovereignty  and  interest,  maintaining  good  relations  including promoting tolerance, mutual respect and understanding among all  peoples  and  actors  of  all  nations.  As  a  Member  State  of ASEAN, Malaysia is committed in preserving ASEAN region as a Zone of Peace, Freedom and Neutrality (ZOPFAN).  .  Malaysia  also  reaffirms  its  commitment  towards  global peace,  security  and  prosperity  by  continuing  to  lead  on  the issuance of a Joint Communique on global ceasefire in June this year. We strongly believe that the UN membership must speak with  one  voice  on  the  need  for  an  immediate  cessation  of hostilities  in  all  corners  of  the  world.  This  would  allow governments  and  all  stakeholders  to  focus  their  attention  on combating humankind’s deadliest enemy.                 The Situation in Myanmar and the Rohingya issue  .  Nevertheless, Mr. President, it is unfortunate that we are far from  realizing  this  global  ceasefire.    Many  places  are  still experiencing  instability.    The  situation  in  Myanmar  remains  of grave concern.   .  Malaysia  cannot  emphasize  enough  the  importance  of respecting  the  will  and  interests  of  the  people  of  Myanmar.  There is a need for a peaceful solution to be found, especially with a multitude of challenges besetting the country.   .  Malaysia  is  particularly  worried  about  the  humanitarian situation,  now  further  aggravated  by  Myanmar’s  healthcare system, which is stretched thin.  It is absolutely essential for aid to reach those in need.    .  Equally  troubling  is  the  refugee  crisis  that  has  engulfed Myanmar since the mass exodus of Rohingya in 2017.  Malaysia currently  hosts  more  than  154,000  refugees  from  Myanmar, comprising % of the refugee population in the country.  More than % of those are from the Rohingya ethnic minority and this is just a conservative estimate.   .  ASEAN  Member  States  have  taken  steps  to  engage  key parties  of  this  conflict  to  extend  assistance  where  possible.  Malaysia fully supports the work of the ASEAN Chair’s Special Envoy  on  Myanmar.    However,  we  remain  concerned  that  the authorities have yet to allow ASEAN’s Special Envoy to visit the country.  We urge the authorities to accept the visit and assist the  Special  Envoy  in  his  duties  as  well  as  expedite  the implementation of the ‘Five-Point Consensus’.                  The Palestinian issue   Mr. President,  .  On  the  Occupied  Palestinian  Territory  (OPT),  Malaysia  is appalled  by  the  deaths  of  many  Palestinian  civilians,  including women and children, following the brutal attacks by Israel in May this  year.    We  strongly  condemn  repeated  violations  and aggression  by  Israeli  forces  and  settlers  against  Palestinian worshipers in Al-Aqsa Mosque.  The targeted aggression against worshippers is indeed contemptuous to all Muslims, or for any peace-loving religion.  . In fact, let us be truly frank about what is happening in the OPT.    The  systematic  oppression  of  Palestinians  over  many years through discriminatory policies; denial of basic civil rights; imposition  of  harsh  conditions;  large  scale  land  confiscation; and, inhumane acts committed against them tantamount to the crime  of  apartheid.  Yes,  Mr.  President,  apartheid  still  exists  in this world and most of us are just turning a blind eye to this.    Israel  must  be  held .  Malaysia  stresses  again responsible and accountable for all its wrongdoings including its flagrant violations of international law.    that the  establishment  of  an international .  We  welcome commission  of  inquiry  by  the  Human  Rights  Council  to investigate violations of international human rights law during the -day crisis.                     .  Malaysia  continues  to  call  for  the  deployment  of  a temporary  international  presence  in  the  city  of  Al-Quds,  to monitor the cessation of hostilities in the OPT.  The international community must spare no effort to ensure the safety, protection, dignity and well-being of the Palestinian civilian population.   .  While generations have had to endure this oppression, it is time that we pay attention to the voices and roles of the younger generation of Palestinians.  It is time to give them a better future.  They  have  been  suffering  in  dreadful  living  conditions  under illegal Israeli occupation for so many years and we cannot allow this to continue indefinitely.    .  Malaysia  has  and  will  continue  to  lend  its  unwavering support and solidarity to the Palestinians.   The Situation in Afghanistan   .  Turning to the situation in Afghanistan, Malaysia is appalled by  the  terrorist  attack  outside  the  Hamid  Karzai  International Airport  last  month.  The  attack  resulted  in  the  loss  of  innocent lives with many more injured.  Malaysia expresses its deepest condolences  to  the  bereaved  families  of  the  victims.    We  also wish those injured a full recovery.  its in  all terrorism forms  and .  Malaysia  condemns manifestations.  The region cannot be allowed to be turned into a fertile breeding ground for terrorism again.  The world family must come together to support Afghanistan in this time of need, including  by  extending  humanitarian  assistance  to  the  people.  On this, Malaysia stands ready to extend its assistance and do what it can.                 Reform  of  the  UN:  Revitalisation  of  the  General  Assembly and the reform of the Security Council  Mr. President,  . The UN has been in existence for over  years. In that time, the world has changed significantly.  As such, the UN must keep pace with a rapidly changing world as it continues to face a crisis of  expectations.    Reform  is  necessary  to  strengthen  the  UN’s effectiveness  as  a  multilateral  organisation,  to  bring  more transparency to it and to enhance its credibility. On this, we must work together to reform the organisation and we hope Member States will demonstrate openness, flexibility, and political will in the interest of international peace, security, and prosperity.    Conclusion  Mr. President,  .  During  its  inception,  we  looked  to  the  United  Nations  to save humanity from the scourge  of  war.   Today,  we place our resolve in the UN and its Member States to save humanity from the scourge of the global pandemic.  .  The  pandemic  has  shown  that  we  need  to  improve  our resolve and multilateralism, and consider ourselves as a family of nations.    international cooperation strengthen to .  At the same time, the world family must be made a more peaceful, prosperous, sustainable and equitable one.  We must close ranks and enhance our unity and cohesion.  We must live in  peaceful  coexistence.    Only  then  will  we  have  a  chance  to succeed. Thank you.                     "
55,2021,PHL,Philippines,"President,  I congratulate you on your election and welcome your “Presidency of Hope”. Indeed, that is what we need in these challenging times.  For nearly two years now, the pandemic has upended our lives. The climate crisis has worsened, inequalities have deepened, and the geopolitical balance is in a state of dangerous flux.   Certainly, these are complex problems. But one thing is clear – they all hit the poor the hardest. Injustice is the common thread that ties these issues together.    When I spoke before this august body last year, I said that how we address these issues will define our future.  From what I have seen, that future will likely be one of inequality – where the poor plays catch-up with the rich, with no hope nor chance of ever succeeding in closing the gap.  We cannot, in all conscience, allow this to happen. An unjust order is inherently volatile.    We have to reverse course.  How then do we, as governments, reconcile our obligations to our own citizens with our responsibility to the rest of humanity?       For the Philippines, we understand that we need to expand our notion of ‘us’ beyond the nation, so we can work together to secure our common future.    We recognize that only inclusive multilateralism can deliver the global public goods we need.   And we believe that fairness, equality and respect should always be the basis of our engagement with one another.   Only with these can we correct the injustices that doom the downtrodden all over the world to a life of indignity. And for thousands during this pandemic - certain death.  Mr. President, the picture is bleak. There is a man-made drought of vaccines ravaging poor countries.   Rich countries hoard life-saving vaccines, while poor nations wait for trickles. They now talk of booster shots, while developing countries consider half-doses just to get by.   This is shocking beyond belief and must be condemned for what it is – a selfish act that can neither be justified rationally nor morally.   The plain fact is – this pandemic will not end unless the virus is defeated everywhere. Vaccines are key to achieving this.   This is why the Philippines committed One Million Dollars to the UN’s COVAX Facility. This is our modest contribution to our collective fight against COVID-.  We strongly urge our privileged partners to fully support the COVAX Facility and further strengthen other cooperation mechanisms. We need this to save more lives, break the cycle of variants and help ensure global economic recovery.  Just as COVID- has had an uneven impact on peoples, climate change has also exposed the varying vulnerabilities of countries around the globe. The risks and burden of a warming climate are simply not the same for everyone.   The greatest injustice here is that those who suffer the most are those the least responsible for this existential crisis.   But here we are now at a critical tipping point, where failure to act leads to cataclysmic consequences for the whole of humankind.      The Philippines accepts its share of responsibility and will do its part to avert this collective disaster. We have submitted our first Nationally Determined Contribution, with a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by % by 2030.   I issued a moratorium on the construction of new coal power plants and a directive to explore the nuclear energy option.   But this contribution will be rendered useless if the biggest polluters – past and present – choose to do ‘business as usual’. We therefore appeal for urgent climate action, especially from those that can truly tip the balance.   Developed countries must fulfill their longstanding commitment to climate financing, technology transfer, and capacity-building in the developing  world. This a moral obligation that cannot be avoided.   Our world’s transition to a green economy must not be at the expense of developing countries’ economic vitality. It simply cannot be – or it would be another travesty of justice.  Mr. President, the Filipino people aspire for a stable, comfortable and secure life founded on freedom, justice and equality.  We have made significant strides to this end, after more than a century of nation-building. Today, the Philippines is a middle-income economy and a thriving democracy. But difficult challenges remain – this we do not deny.   Millions of Filipinos work abroad under the most difficult and inhumane of circumstances. We call for the abolition of all structures that allow the exploitation and oppression of migrant workers.   The kafala system is one such behemoth that chains the weak, the desperate, and the voiceless to an existence of unimaginable suffering.   Nothing can justify the continued existence of this unjust system.  While reforms have been made, the kafala system must be dismantled – sooner rather than later – in the name of justice and basic decency.      The Philippines seeks stronger partnerships to protect the rights of Filipinos and realize the full potential of our nation.  But let me be clear – what we mean is partnership that respects our peoples’ agency.       Let me say this again: My Government has a mandate and an obligation to my people. We will deal with all criminals – including terrorists – with the full force of our laws.    The Filipino people want to live in peace and security in their homes and communities – free from harm and danger from the lawless.  But achieving this goal has not been without challenges.  I say this in no uncertain terms: The law applies to all.  I have instructed the Department of Justice and the Philippine National Police to review the conduct of our campaign against illegal drugs. Those found to have acted beyond bounds during operations shall be made accountable before our laws.   We have recently finalized with the United Nations our Joint Program on Human Rights. This is a model for constructive engagement between a sovereign Member State and the United Nations.   Meaningful change, to be enduring, must come from within. The imposition of one’s will over another – no matter how noble the intent – has never worked in the past. And it never will in the future.  How many more countries shall be made to unravel and descend into chaos before the powerful heed this simple lesson?  In dealing with complex problems in nation-building, let us consider pragmatic approaches that square ideals with reality. Sure, they may lead us to imperfect solutions – but solutions, nonetheless, that actually work.   We all pay the price for the misadventures of the few that spiral into humanitarian disasters.   The Philippines, in line with its longstanding humanitarian tradition, has opened its doors to Afghan nationals, especially women and children, fleeing from conflict.  As one global community, we must do our utmost to help the Afghan people and all those who continue to suffer.  For the Rohingyas,  I have instructed our Department of Justice to work closely with the UN High Commissioner on Refugees to prepare a cooperation program for a specific number of Rohingyas, consistent with our capacities.        The Philippines has limited resources during these extraordinary times. But what we can do for humanity and to uplift human dignity, we will.   Mr. President, in a period of profound geopolitical change, it is vital that all countries – big and small – commit to the rule of law. FULLY AND FIRMLY.   For a world without law is a world of disaster, where the weak is at the mercy of the strong. There can therefore be no other acceptable basis for global order but the law.   We must resolve disputes peacefully, as we manifested in the Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes.  The Philippines is one with ASEAN and other stakeholders in ensuring that the South China Sea remains a sea of peace, security and prosperity.   The 1982 UNCLOS and the 2016 Arbitral Award on the South China Sea provide a clear path towards a just, fair, and win-win solution for all.  The Award must be seen for what it is – a benefit across the board to all who subscribe to the majesty of the law.   No amount of willful disregard by any country, however big and powerful, can diminish the Arbitral Award’s importance.   Mr. President, we face multiple crises that demand effective global governance. Yet, our institutions, including the United Nations, have proven to be inadequate.   The UN is a product of an era long past. It no longer reflects the political and economic realities of today.   Democracy and transparency are concepts that reverberate in the halls of the UN. But ironically, the Security Council – the pinnacle of the UN structure – violates every tenet of these values. It is neither democratic nor transparent in its representation and processes. Many member states have spoken firmly and we agree: This simply is not right.    If the UN is to lead the world out of the many crises we face, things need to change. The UN must empower itself, by reforming itself. Therein lies the hope for humanity.         Thank you. END "
56,2021,SGP,Singapore,"President, Excellencies, friends and colleagues.  . Let me congratulate His Excellency Abdulla Shahid on assuming the Presidency of the 76th session of the General Assembly. I also thank His Excellency Volkan Bozkir, for his leadership of the 75th session during an unprecedented and difficult year.  . The most important lesson from the COVID- pandemic is that multilateral cooperation is essential to overcome the challenges of our global commons. Only coordinated international action can lead us to a sustainable, inclusive, and resilient recovery.  . This is why the role of the United Nations is so crucial, especially for small and developing countries.     . The UN must empower countries to deal with the challenges of managing our global commons in order to build a more resilient future.   . I want to welcome and commend the leadership of UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, not only over the past year but in putting forth a bold and visionary Common Agenda to reposition and adapt the United Nations for the future.  . In particular, I welcome his proposal for a Summit of the Future to forge a new global consensus. . Today, I wish to highlight four key areas that require our urgent attention: public health, climate change, oceans, and the digital revolution.    . First, the fight against COVID- is far from over.  . Access to vaccines remains the biggest problem faced by many countries. Our immediate priority must be to redouble efforts to expand access to vaccines by scaling up production and distribution.  . Singapore is a strong supporter of vaccine multilateralism. We will continue to support the COVAX Facility, and will donate our vaccines under the COVAX initiative to other countries with greater needs.   . We have continued to help our friends and neighbours where we can, through other contributions of medical supplies, oxygen, and equipment.  . As a transshipment hub, Singapore has always played our part to keep essential supplies moving to where they are needed most.  . In the longer term, we need to take forward the recommendations of the G20 High Level Independent Panel to address major gaps in preparedness for future pandemics, strengthen multilateral support for the WHO and UN, and mobilise resources for our collective security – because no one is safe until everyone is safe. . This brings me to my second point: we need a sustained and ambitious global response to address climate change.  . The effects of climate change are deeply felt at a local level, but the solution depends on a collective response at the global level.  . For small island nations like Singapore, climate change remains a clear and present danger.   . Recent extreme weather events are stark reminders that we do not have time to lose.     . The IPCC’s landmark report has concluded that global temperatures are likely to rise above . degrees Celsius in the next two decades, and we are likely to see more intense rainfall, flooding and droughts, loss of sea ice, and rising sea levels. . The fight against climate change will be a stark litmus test of our ability to manage the global commons through multilateral action.  . No country acting alone can move the needle. But if we work together, we can make a substantial impact. If we fail, the consequences will be calamitous for every country and for all humanity. . Singapore has always been a strong advocate of the Paris Agreement from the beginning.  . Last year, even while battling the pandemic, we submitted our enhanced 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution to the Paris Agreement and our Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy for 2050 and beyond.  . This year, we unveiled the Singapore Green Plan 2030, which outlines a whole-of-nation approach to sustainable development, and charts ambitious, concrete targets over the next  years. Among others, we will plant one million more   trees, quadruple solar energy deployments, and reduce waste sent to landfills.  . We are also committed to working with partners in new areas such as green finance and clean energy solutions. . And we look forward to substantive outcomes at the upcoming UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow. . The third global commons in urgent need of multilateral action are our oceans.  . The oceans sustain our global ecosystem; they are a repository of biodiversity and a buffer for climate change. They are also a critical artery for trade, and a source of jobs and livelihood for billions of people.  . As a tiny island state at the confluence of key global shipping routes, heavily dependent on maritime trade, Singapore is an ardent advocate for the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea or UNCLOS.  . UNCLOS is the foundation for rules-based governance of the oceans in all its aspects. It sets the rules for maritime entitlements and provides the overarching framework for the   peaceful resolution of maritime disputes. It is fundamental to maintaining open trade routes and sea lines of communication.  . The 40th anniversary of the adoption of UNCLOS next year is an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to UNCLOS as the primary legal instrument for oceans governance, and do more to ensure its effective implementation.   . Singapore also firmly believes in the importance of conserving and ensuring the sustainability of our marine environment. So we look forward to the fourth session of the BBNJ Intergovernmental Conference next year, and to the second UN Ocean Conference to be co-hosted by Kenya and Portugal next year. . The fourth area for urgent multilateral action relates to the digital revolution and its impact on sustainable development. . The digital revolution was well underway before COVID-. But the pandemic has accelerated the pace and scale of this revolution.  . Digital technologies have empowered millions of people. But the gulf of opportunities between digital haves and digital have-nots has also widened. . Today, . billion people remain digitally disconnected.       . The digital divide has prevented access to education, health care, and many other essential services to millions of people around the world.   . Digital transformation is not just about new technologies and new hardware. . Fundamentally, it is about improving lives and empowering people, especially the poorest and most vulnerable. It is about strengthening the resilience of our societies and economies. . In a nutshell, digital transformation should be about sustainable development.  . To put it differently, if we do not close the digital divide, we will not achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. That is why digitalisation poses a global challenge that requires a concerted global response.    . There are many questions related to digital transformation.   . How can we provide fair and secure access to digital data, so that data is not monopolised by the few, leaving the vast majority digitally disenfranchised?   . How can we encourage a freer flow of data across the world, to promote innovation and inclusive sustainable development?       . Can we find ways to address the pandemic of misinformation, which has sometimes been arguably worse than the pandemic itself? . There are no ready answers. But we clearly need to have a conversation about a global framework to maximise the opportunities and deal with the challenges posed by digital transformation.  . The goal is both simple and singular: how can we enhance multilateral cooperation to leverage digital technologies for sustainable development?   . There are many paths we can take: the Secretary-General’s proposal for a Global Digital Compact, or a new UN convention on digital transformation for sustainable development, or a framework of norms and principles. These options are part of the conversation that we need to have at the global level.  . As a small country, a vital node in the international digital network, Singapore has always advocated a global architecture that is open, inclusive, inter-operable, and multi-stakeholder.  . Such a global digital architecture must be shaped by a few guiding principles:    . One, the voices of small states must be heard and our concerns taken into account. . Two, digital transformation needs to be people-focused, and improve people’s daily lives.  . Three, we need to involve all relevant stakeholders: the government, the private sector, civil society, because it is no longer possible in today’s digital world to neatly draw lines between government, industry, and citizens. . Four, we have to “think digital”, which means thinking in an integrated, multi-disciplinary, multi-sectoral way. Complex problems require innovative solutions. . And five, we need concrete action, through identifying a common set of “digital development goals” and a framework for multilateral cooperation. . At the national level, Singapore is already building partnerships with many countries.  . We have concluded Digital Economy Agreements with several partners. . We co-lead the WTO Joint Statement Initiative on e-commerce with Japan and Australia, which now includes more than  member economies and comprise % of global trade.   . These can be building blocks in a larger global architecture. . At the broader level, we need determined action to close the digital divide, not only within nations but also between nations.  . There is already much work being done. But we need to give these efforts a stronger push, through education, training, and, improving digital skills and literacy across the board; investing in infrastructure, for universal and affordable internet connectivity; and expanding access to data and digital public goods, including open-source software and digital utilities. . We can do much more to improve international data governance, to promote inter-operability, trust, and security when we transact in the digital environment. . I have only touched on some of the issues we need to look at. There are other important issues outlined in the Secretary-General’s Roadmap for Digital Cooperation. The Common Agenda also lays out a way forward, on a global “digital technology track”. . The next step is to take action on these proposals, and Singapore will support efforts by the UN to advance our global conversation. So that together, we can make tangible progress on digital transformation for sustainable development.    . Mr President, Excellencies, friends and colleagues, . As we seek to build a more inclusive, sustainable future, we need to give each other a hand. This is especially so for small and developing countries. . In 1992, Singapore established the Forum of Small States, or FOSS, an informal platform for small states to discuss issues of mutual concern.  .

57,2021,THA,Thailand,"President,  Distinguished delegates,  Very warm greetings from Thailand, .    First of all, I am delighted to extend my warmest congratulations to His Excellency  Mr.  Abdulla  Shahid  on  his  election  as  President  of  the  76th  session  of  UN  General Assembly.  .    At  the  end  of  last  year,  we  believed  that  the  rollout  of  vaccines  would  be  the  beginning  of  the  end  of  the  COVID-  pandemic.  However,  in  reality,  viruses  are constantly mutating, taking new forms and spreading faster than earlier forms. The variants have raised concerns about the efficacy of existing COVID- vaccines and tend to become endemic which means that the viruses are here to stay for years to come. Thus, it is crucial that all countries learn to coexist with COVID- and foster quality societies in the ‘next normal’ world.  .    With  COVID-,  the  global  community  is  confronting  one  of  the  most  serious  multi-dimensional challenges of our lifetime. To compound this situation, climate-induced catastrophes have also aggravated the ongoing turmoil caused by the pandemic and created tremendous  losses,  while  further  disrupting  global  efforts  towards  the  realization  of  the Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs).  These  unfortunate  events  also  affect  the livelihoods of the global population, especially those living in developing countries.  .    In  this  connection,  I  would  like  to  congratulate  the  Secretary-General  for  his  “Our Common Agenda” report, which envisages closer global cooperation on key issues and reinvigorating inclusive, networked, and effective multilateralism in order to foster a peaceful international environment, as well as a better and more sustainable future for all. .    I agree with you, Mr. President, that in this world full of chaos, the most important things for us are “hope” and the aspiration towards building a better future by focusing on  balanced  and  people-centric  development  that  leaves  nobody  behind.  I  believe  that  the crises and challenges we face today have presented us with an opportunity to learn from past lessons, to reorient our approach and to better prepare for the future. With this in mind,  I  would  like  to  encourage  everyone  to  turn  crisis  into  opportunity  –  an  opportunity  to reform multilateral cooperation and make it a genuine driver of change. This demands a reaffirmation of faith in multilateralism since no national capabilities, however large, can on their own be adequate to effect meaningful change or transition. We need global-scale solidarity and cooperation that is commensurate with the scale of the crisis. We must build global immunity and deal with challenges in a sustainable and concrete manner.              Mr. President,  .    The COVID- pandemic is living proof that nobody is safe until everybody is safe.  In this regard, I urge that COVID- vaccines and medicines be considered as global public goods which can be accessible to all in an equitable and rapid manner. Any country that has surplus COVID- vaccines and medicines in hand is encouraged to share them with those in need, either through donations or swap arrangements. At the same time, research and development on vaccines, medicines and necessary medical equipment must also be encouraged in order to better equip and elevate the medical industries of countries around the world to deal with emerging diseases of the future. .    Moreover,  every  country  must  take  actions  to  strengthen  public  health  systems, particularly on achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and supporting efforts within the scope of the World Health Organization (WHO) to collectively enhance global health security. This includes the call for a new Pandemic Treaty and the imperative to rethink the paradigm of global health security – one that focuses on equal and borderless access to public  health  services.  As  for  Thailand,  we  have  also  been  promoting  integration  and coherence between health and disaster risk management, both natural-related and emerging diseases-related. Thailand encourages the international community to utilize the Bangkok Principles  which  provide  guidance  on  the  implementation  of  the  health  aspects  of  the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. I believe that the building of a resilient, equitable and fair global health system will be a fundamental basis for our recovery in a sustainable manner.  Indeed, fighting against COVID- is not an individual competition that has a definite . winner or loser. Instead, it is a team sport and we are all in the same team. So, a win-all situation  is  our  shared  goal.  Recently,  we  have  seen  positive  trends  in  coping  with  the COVID-  pandemic  in  many  parts  of  the  world,  as  well  as  enhanced  collaboration  in vaccine  production  and  distribution  through  bilateral  and  multilateral  frameworks.  Thus, I strongly believe that we will overcome this health crisis together.    Mr. President, .    As  I  mentioned  earlier,  due  to  unbalanced  growth  and  development,  the  world  is facing a growing existential threat of natural catastrophes connected with climate change on  an  unprecedented  scale.  Over  the  past  centuries,  we  have  carelessly  enjoyed  and,  at times,  exploited  planet  earth’s  environment  without  listening  to  the repeated  warning        signals  sent  over  time.  We  are  now  inevitably  left  with  self-inflicted  consequences  that  we have to bear with for the next  years.      .   Such a future might not seem to be bright and shiny. But if we continue on our current path,  the  global  temperature  change  might  rise  beyond    degrees  Celsius  which  would result in even more catastrophic changes. Heat waves and extreme weather events are likely to  be  more  frequent  and  increasingly  intense,  leading  to  disruptions  in  agriculture  and harvesting seasons and may lead to food security crises. It is, therefore, a quintessential agenda  on  Thailand’s  priorities  as  we  are  rich  in  biodiversity  with  a  large  agricultural sector. I view the organization of the Food Systems Summit this week as reflecting the due importance that should be given to food security, and hope that the global community will be able to find sustainable solutions.  .   Thailand  is  in  the  process  of  preparing  the  National  Energy  Plan  with  an  aim  to achieve  carbon  neutrality  by  2065-2070.  At  the  same  time,  we  have  set  the  target  to increase the proportion of renewable energy to at least  per cent of the total amount of electricity generated. We are committed to increase the use of electric vehicles (EV) to  per cent of total domestic vehicles. In this regard, Thailand urges developed countries to take  lead  in  significantly  reducing  in  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  and  calls  on  the  global community  to  take  collective  actions  to  ensure  constructive  and  concrete  outcomes  at COP26. .   But I believe that every cloud has a silver lining. I would like to emphasize that we must turn the crisis into an opportunity  to reengineer the way the world works to better prepare for the transformative  reset to ensure “Balance of All Things”. It is particularly important  to  foster  balanced  development  that  is  environment-friendly.  Accordingly,  the  global  community  has  to  accelerate  cooperation  on  Science,  Technology  and Innovation (STI), especially by investing in clean and renewable energy, energy storage technology,  electric  vehicles,  and  relevant  infrastructure.  For  its  part,  Thailand  remains committed to carry forward our initiative on the Eastern Economic Corridor or the EEC to be a jewel in the crown for international creative economy. We emphasize the importance of financial assistance and technology transfers for research&development and innovation extended  to  developing  countries  through  various  cooperative  frameworks.  This  would boost their capacities and increase their participation in addressing global problems as well as enable them to swiftly adjust to changes, build immunity and better recover from global warming in a sustainable manner.       Mr. Presidents, Distinguished delegates, .  Driving forward realization of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) across all sectors is a key instrument to respond to the challenges the world is facing, and to deal with inequalities  exacerbated  by  the  COVID-  pandemic.  Financing  for  development, therefore,  is  of  crucial  importance.  The  international  community  must  place  due importance on the implementation of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, as well as to other economic  measures  vital  for  stimulating  economic  recovery  in  developing  countries, especially the Least Developing Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island  Developing  States.  Therefore,  I  call  on  the  international  community  to  mobilize utmost  efforts  to  assist  these  countries  in  overcoming  pressing  development  challenges. Thailand,  as  the  ASEAN  Coordinator  on  Sustainable  Development  Cooperation,  is  committed  to  promoting  complementarities  between  the  ASEAN  Community  Vision 2025  and  the  2030  Agenda  for  Sustainable  Development  to  boost  the  post  COVID- pandemic recovery, as well as to contribute to global immunity against future challenges.  .  I firmly believe that balance is at the heart of the realization of the SDGs and is a key instrument for dealing with crises and challenges, whether from emerging diseases, food security,  threats  to  biodiversity,  human  rights  problems,  or  poverty  eradication.  Last  July,  Thailand  submitted  our  second  Voluntary  National  Review  (VNR)  on  the Implementation  of  the  2030  Agenda  for  Sustainable  Development.  The  report  placed emphasis on the application of the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy (SEP) as guidelines for  achieving  the  SDGs  including  through  the  promotion  of  the  Bio-Circular-Green Economy  Model.  The  BCG  Economy  Model  constitutes  a  balanced  and  sustainable approach  to  development,  encompassing  economic,  social  and  environmental  aspects through  application  of  technology  and  innovation  that  are  connected  to  global  supply chains. Moreover, Thailand pays great attention to the promotion of global food security through the adoption of the New Theory Agriculture, accompanied by initiatives such as the  Agriculture  for  School  Lunch  Project,  under  the  patronage  of  Her  Royal  Highness Princess  Maha  Chakri  Sirindhorn,  as  prototype  to  instill  a  sustainable  consumption approach into the youth.  Mr. President, .  Peace  and  stability  are  an  indispensable  foundation  for  driving  forward  the Sustainable Development Agenda, leaving no-one behind. It is, therefore, crucial for the global community to join hands in creating a peaceful environment by promoting mutual trust and solidarity, particularly among the major powers. Thailand has continuously played      a  role  on  questions  of  sustaining  peace  and  in  peacekeeping  and  security  processes, including  by  seeking  a  constructive  role  in  the  Peacebuilding  Commission  (PBC)  and making voluntary contributions to the Peacebuilding Fund (PBF). Meanwhile, Thai police and military forces continue to participate actively in UN missions in support of the vital work  of  peace  building.  In  so  doing,  we  also  believe  that  promoting  the  development agenda in conflict areas will help resolve the root causes of problems.  .  The situation of Afghanistan has brought home the realization that the international community  must  come  together  to  strengthen  stability  and  security  across  the  regions. Thailand is particularly concerned  with the humanitarian  situation  as we, the peoples of Thailand  and  Afghanistan,  belong  to  the  same  Asian  region.  Thailand,  therefore,  has pledged a financial contribution of 150,000 USD to support the work of UN organizations in order to alleviate humanitarian crisis there. We have also made financial contributions to assist with the situation in Haiti. .  Thailand and other Core Group states consider the entry into force of the Treaty on the  Prohibition  of  Nuclear  Weapon  (TPNW)  on    January  2021  as  an  encouraging manifestation of the determination of the global community to comply with commitments under  the  UN  Charter  in  promoting  a  world  that  is  free  from  nuclear  weapons  for succeeding  generations.  Given  this  positive  development  despite  current  international tensions,  the  global  community  should  take  heart  and  seek  to  collectively  deepen collaboration in various fields, such as on cyber issues and peaceful applications of nuclear technology.  In  this  connection,  Thailand  further  supports  building  complementarities between cooperation under the TPNW and the Treaty on the Non – Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).  .   Thailand is committed to supporting efforts in fostering an environment of peace and reconciliation  in  Myanmar  through  multilateral  diplomacy.  As  a  close  neighbour  and fellow  ASEAN  Member  State,  Thailand  has  been  closely  following  developments,  and fully supports the implementation  of the Five-Point Consensus  agreed upon by ASEAN leaders, accompanied by cooperation on health and humanitarian assistance. Thailand has continously  provided  concrete  humanitarian  assistance  to  the  people  of  Myanmar, particularly in dealing with the COVID- pandemic, through various channels such as the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management (AHA Centre) which has a satellite warehouse in Thailand’s Chai Nat Province, as well as through UN agencies.      Mr. President, Distinguished delegates, .  At the moment, the COVID- situation in Thailand is still as challenging as in many other countries. However, I do believe that ongoing endeavour to build the immunity of people against the virus remains crucial. In this regard, Universal Health Coverage (UHC) will  continue  to  serve  as  an  efficient  tool  to  deal  with  health  challenges  and  emerging diseases. Thailand has also leveraged the strength of our Village Volunteers system and Thai traditional knowledge to fight against COVID-. We are proud of having been able to  draw  on  ‘Fah  Talai  Chon’,  a  local  Thai  herb,  as  an  alternative  medicine  to  relieve COVID- symptoms. It has become an example of how local Thai wisdom can be further developed to generate wider benefits. .  December this year will mark the 75th anniversary of Thailand’s membership in the United Nations. As the representative of Thailand, I am immensely proud that, throughout the past  years, Thailand has been a responsible, reliable and constructive member and development partner of the UN across all  pillars. Moreover, Thailand is honoured to act as  a  superhub  for  the  UN  in  Asia,  hosting  over    agencies.  We,  hereby,  reaffirm  our commitments  as  host  country  and  will  continue  our  strong  support  for  the  Life-cycle Replacement  and  Seismic  Mitigation  Project  (SMP)  of  the  UN  Economic  and  Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP). .   Furthermore,  Thailand  has  strong  determination  to  be  a  regional  centre  for international cooperation and training. We have always attached importance to promoting development  cooperation  and  assistance  in  various  areas  through  South-South  and triangular cooperation. Thailand, in collaboration with the UNESCAP and the UN Office for South-South Cooperation, will therefore, co-host the Global South-South Development Expo in Bangkok in 2022.  .  And  in  2022,  Thailand  will  be  the  host  of  Asia  Pacific  Economic  Cooperation (APEC). The  main priorities that Thailand is driving forward are: () facilitating trade and investment; () rebooting regional connectivity, particularly in the travel and tourism industry; and () advancing sustainable and inclusive growth. These priorities underscore Thailand’s  commitment  to  promoting  multilateral  cooperation  to  ensure  balanced development in the post-COVID- world. We hope to welcome the world to Thailand in the present context of constant change.        .  Excellencies, history has empirically taught us that after sufferings, comes growth and prosperity.  Thus,  I  am  confident  that  multilateral  cooperation  in  the  response  to  the COVID- pandemic, especially under the UN framework, will lead to great advances in  the  field  of  medical  science.  Equally,  the  strength  of  the  international  community  in tackling the global warming crisis will serve as a catalyst for breakthroughs in advanced technology and innovation. Resilient adaptation and swift response to challenges will be an asset for us to address the problems of today, to be better prepared for challenges of tomorrow,  to  achieve  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals,  and  ultimately  to  build  back  a better world.  Thank you, Sawasdee krab. * * * * * * * * * *    "
58,2021,TLS,Timor-Leste,"President of the United Nations General Assembly, Mr. Abdulla Shahid, Excellency the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Antnio Guterres, Excellencies, Precisely  years ago Timor-Leste became the 191st Member of the United Nations, and it is an honour for me to stand in front of all you today to address the General Assembly at its 76th Session. I would like to congratulate the President of the General Assembly, H.E. Mr. Adbulla Shahid and appreciate the contributions made by his predecessor, H.E. Mr. Volkan Bozkir, and commend his qualified leadership and determination in leading the Assembly during a difficult time, as well as for making an in person session possible. Timor-Leste would also like to congratulate H.E. Mr. Antnio Guterres on his re-appointment as the Secretary-General of the United Nations. The theme chosen by the President of the General Assembly for the General Debate of the 76th Session accurately captures the opportunities and challenges our United Nations is facing. Excellencies, The COVID- pandemic has created global challenges affecting not only the health sector, but also  has  created  a  devastating  impact  on  the  socioeconomic  sector  by  reversing  hard-won achievements, generating economic recession, and further exacerbated the pre-existing structural challenges, deepening inequality among nations, causing social distress, conflict and hunger that eventually pushed people into extreme poverty. The United Nations has a key political role in mobilizing international cooperation and solidarity to  address  the  current  global  multifaceted  and  interlinked  pandemic  challenges.  The  United Nations  needs  to  continue  serving  as  a  platform  for  international  cooperation  and  worldwide           solidarity  to  address  the  current  COVID-  pandemic  in  order  to  build  back  better  in  a  more resilient and sustainable manner. In this context, it is pertinent that international cooperation addresses the socioeconomic impact of COVID- and focused on the most disadvantaged and vulnerable people and countries, especially the  Least  Developing  Countries  (LDCs),  Small  Islands  Developing  States  (SIDS),  Landlocked Developing States (LLDCs) and countries in conflict and those emerging from conflict, in order to alleviate their structural challenges that are further exacerbated by the pandemic. Excellencies, Since the beginning of the pandemic, Timor-Leste has recorded more than nineteen thousand cases with  more  than  eighteen  thousand  having  fully  recovered  and  one  hundred  and  thirteen  (113) deaths (//2021). As an LDC and SIDS, the COVID- puts a high pressure to our already weak health system, with lack of facilities and resources to effectively cope with the pandemic.  My country continues to endorse vaccine as a global public good, that needs to be accessible to everyone, including developing and low economic countries and countries in special situation. The international  community  must  address  the  vaccination  gaps  at  low  income  countries  who  only vaccinate .% of their populations. Without equal access to vaccines, many countries, including Timor-Leste will not be able to protect its citizens and people from the virus. Timor-Leste commends the development partners, the United Nations, International Organizations and other actors who have contributed to overcoming the circumstances of COVID-. Our deep gratitude for the generosity of our partners, which allowed us to administer more than six hundred thousand doses, thus vaccinating a total of % of its adult population. Excellencies, Climate change continued to be at the top of our agenda. We are experiencing the hardship of climate  change  impact  while  battling  against  the  covid-  pandemic.  Countries  in  special          situations including Timor-Leste are often forced to deal with severe climate events such as floods, landslides, droughts, sea level rise and global warming, which eventually undermine our existence and threaten humanity and human rights. In our national context, the Government has been committed to reforestation and correction of watercourse beds. It is also worth mentioning the Government’s action to combat plastic waste. In fact, the reforestation action ensures greater rainfall and a cleaner environment. Reinforcing this action, the President of the Republic launched the national campaign “A citizen, a tree”, which has had special support from youth organizations. Reaffirming the action in this area, the President of the Republic has recently appointed a Special Envoy and Roving Ambassador of Timor-Leste to ensure our representation and ensure that our voice is heard in international discussions and negotiations on issues related to climate change. As  we  are  preparing  for  Glasgow  this  year,  Timor-Leste  appreciates  the  preparatory  process undertaken  and  looks  forward  for  a  productive  outcome  of  COP26  for  generating  international cooperation to scale up global efforts to fulfilling our obligations under the Paris Agreement to protect  our  planet  for  current  and  future  generation  based  on  common  but  differentiated responsibilities.  Excellencies, There are  years remaining from achieving the global targets of Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. However, we are far from achieving the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development goals with the current low pace of the development. The LDCs are furthest left behind, many of the LDCs have high levels of external dependency and exposure and low levels of resilience to recover from socioeconomic shocks, compounded by effects of climate change that has made achieving the SDGs even more challenging.  Timor-Leste welcomes the report and recommendations of the Secretary-General of the United Nations  on  Our  Common  Agenda  to  best  respond  to  our  current  and  future  challenges,  in  this         regards the government of Timor-Leste has contributed a sum of ,000 thousand  USD to support the Secretary-General’s efforts. We have come to an end of the implementation of the Istanbul Programme for Action for LDCs, however we have seen no much progress made in its realization, hence it is important that our recovery efforts from the pandemic should focus on addressing the barriers in the realization of the Istanbul Program of Action for achieving the sustainable development goals. Above all, Timor-Leste wishes to reiterate that SDG16 shall be the catalyst for development, given that  peace,  justice,  inclusion  and  strong  institutions  would  create  the  conditions  for  economic growth and are the foundation for decent work, health education and prosperous nations. Excellencies, Timor-Leste is fully committed to the principle of multilateralism enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, such as respect for sovereignty, political independence, territorial integrity and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States. Timor-Leste  is  considered  as  one  of  the  success  stories  of  the  United  Nations’  engagement  in realizing  the  principle  of  the  right  of  self-determination.  Our  experience  in  undertaking reconciliation  process  with  Indonesia  following  its  invasion  and  occupation,  illustrates  the importance of reconciliation to restore good relations and cooperation, despite the past pain and tragedy. Therefore, Timor-Leste continues to promote peace building and state building through the sharing of experiences on reconciliation and justice through south-south cooperation and the g7+, which is the platform for cooperation and solidarity between countries affected by conflict, fragility and on transition towards resilience.  Timor-Leste is also committed to upholding international law and the international rules-based order, promotes the use of peaceful settlement mechanism to settle differences and disputes. In relation  to  this,  Timor-Leste  has  led  by  example  in  utilizing  for  the  first  time  ever,  the  United         Nations  Convention  on  the  Law  of  the  Sea  Compulsory  Conciliation  Committee  to  resolve  its maritime boundary dispute with Australia. We  wish  to  underscore  that  unilateral  economic,  commercial  and  financial  embargo  is  in contravention  of  the  values  and  principles  enshrined  in  the  Charter  of  the  United  Nations. Therefore,  Timor-Leste  continues  to  be  greatly  concerned  with  the  prolonged  economic, commercial and financial embargo that has been imposed against Cuba for more than six decades and has caused harsh impact in the lives of the Cuban people and the development of the country, including the efforts of Cuba in effectively coping with the COVID- pandemic. In this sense, Timor-Leste firmly supports the lifting of the embargo and opposes any extra-territorial measures. We are also concerned about the increasing of tension and conflict in Myanmar and Afghanistan, which resulted in the loss of lives, deterioration of human rights and loss of shelters and hinder access to basic services. Timor-Leste calls upon all parties involved, to solve their divergences through dialogues and reconciliation to reach a peaceful and permanent solutions. In the specific situation of Myanmar, Timor-Leste welcomes the regional mechanism to address the  security  and  socioeconomic  challenges  and  appreciates  the  -points  consensus  adopted  by ASEAN in its last leaders’ meeting.  In  the  case  of  Afghanistan,  Timor-Leste  would  also  like  to  call  for  the  respect  of  the  rights  of women’s right and the rights of Afghan people and foreigners who wish to leave the country. In the context of multilateralism, we wish to underline that language and culture connect us and foster our partnership with the countries and people of the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries,  which  we  are  proud  to  be  part  of,  in  the  context  of  south-south  and  north  south cooperation. The culture and the language that we have adopted as one of our official languages has  helped  to foster  quality  education,  expand  knowledge  and  strengthen  our  people  to  people connection.  We  believe  that  Portuguese  language  that  is  spoken  by  approximately  280  million people worldwide in 2021 could also be considered as one of the UN official languages.         Excellencies, As we are embarking in the Fourth decade for the eradication of colonialism, Timor-Leste wishes to take this opportunity to urge the United Nations to commit to the work the Special Committee on  Decolonization  (C-)  aiming  at  realizing  the  decolonization  of  the  remaining    non-self-governing territories, to enabling those people in the territories to exercise their rights for self-determination. Timor-Leste also wishes to take the opportunity to refer to the Western Sahara, whereby the United Nations Mission MINURSO has been in the territory for about three decades, but progress has yet to be seen satisfactorily. Thus, we reiterate once again our appeal to the Secretary-General of the United Nations for his Special Envoy for Western Sahara to urgently reactivate the negotiation process between the Polisario Front and Morocco, and to allow the people of Western Sahara to exercise  their  right  to  self-determination,  based  on  the  Charter  of  the  United  Nations  and  its relevant resolutions. Timor-Leste maintains diplomatic relations with both Israel and Palestine, and it is our opinion that a lasting solution is only possible with the existence, side by side, of the State of Israel and the State of Palestine. Excellencies, We are living in an everchanging world where the speed of change goes hand in hand with growing uncertainty. After  years of existence, different challenges and circumstances require effective global  response  through  cooperation  and  partnership.  To  keep  us  on  the  right  pace,  there  is  an urgent need to restructure our Organization that is committed to Peace, Security and Development. In this sense, Timor-Leste appreciates the efforts in revitalizing our Organization to adjust with the  challenges  of  our  current  situation  and  we  reiterate  our  full  support  to  the  United  Nations Security Council reform to better reflect our contemporary world and to properly address global challenges in the areas of Peace, Security and Development.         Excellencies, Timor-Leste is fully committed to the protection and promotion of human rights and has ratified  core Human Rights Treaties and their protocols. On  this  occasion,  Timor-Leste  wishes  to  emphasize  its  commitment  to  the  promotion  and protection of women's rights. Timor-Leste has made extensive efforts to achieve gender equality, through Policies, Legislation and Programs that contribute to achieving this objective. Although we still face cases of gender-based violence and difficulties in accessing justice, Timor-Leste is strongly committed to removing these obstacles from our path in order to achieve gender equality. Timor-Leste is grateful for the support it has been receiving from the United Nations, from our development  partners  and  from  various  civil  society  organizations  that  help  us  in  the  effort  to eliminate gender-based violence in our society. Currently Timor-Leste has made considerable progress in terms of complying with international human  rights  instruments  and  reporting,  and  it  feels  increasingly  confident  to  participate  in discussions and decisions on human rights issue. In addition to the aforementioned national context, as a Country that also went through a bitter experience of human rights violations to restore our independence, and, on the other hand, our existence as a Country, is a success story of the United Nations, in the defense of human rights principles and values. We therefore feel a moral obligation to contribute in promoting human rights at the global level.  Thus, Timor-Leste decided to apply to the Human Rights Council for the period of 2024-2026 with the aim of contributing to the work of this body in promoting and advancing the principles and  values  of  human  rights,  in  the  Country  and  at  a  global  level.  Timor-Leste  counts  with  the support of Member States to be able to contribute in this regard. I thank you.           "
59,2021,VNM,Viet Nam,"President, I  wish  to  extend  my  congratulations  to  Mr.  Abdullah  Shahid  on  the assumption of his duties as the President of the 76th UNGA. I am convinced that under his able leadership and with his vast experience, he will lead our session to success.  I highly appreciate the significant contributions of Mr. Volkan Bozkir in  his  capacity  as  the  President  of  the  75th  UNGA.  I  also  wish  to,  once again,  congratulate  Mr.  Antonio  Guterres  on  his  re-election  as  the  UN Secretary-General.  I  believe  that,  with  his  perseverance  and  dedication,  he  will  work  to  realize  the  Organization’s  directions  and  priorities  in  the years to come.  Mr. President, The  UNGA this  year  convenes  against  a  unique  backdrop,  as the COVID- pandemic is jeopardizing the people’s lives worldwide. I believe  that  all  our  thoughts  these  days  are  with  our  countries  and  our people. And my heart yearns for my homeland Viet Nam, where the entire nation is vigorously combating this pandemic to protect the health and lives of  the  people,  to  sustain  economic  growth  and  to  ensure  social  security, leaving no one behind No  statistical  figures  can  truly  measure  grief  and  loss  caused  by  the  COVID-  pandemic.  This  is,  above  all,  the  loss  of  lives,  and subsequently  severe  economic  damages  and  far-reaching  impacts  on societies and the people’s well-being. The pandemic sounds a warning bell of the shocking destruction  that may be caused by  non-traditional security challenges such as diseases or climate change, if they are not addressed at timely and decisively.     The  pandemic  has  also  exposed  the  shortcomings  of  the  global governance system and the increasing inequality among nations.  Nonetheless,  COVID-  is  not  the  sole  challenge  that  we  are  facing today.  Increasing  tensions  among  major  powers  has  led  to  a  divisive  and unstable  international  system.  Wars  are  taking  the  lives  of  many  innocent people.  Disputes  over  territories  and  resources  in  many  areas  are  on  the verge of erupting. The rise of power politics, the disregard for international law,  and  the  unilateral  acts  of  coercion  and  hindrance  against  countries  in exercising their legal rights are still taking place in many regions. In that gloomy picture, what really motivates us are the strong desire for  peace,  cooperation  and  development  among  the  people  around  the globe, and our recognition of the importance of international solidarity and multilateralism. The United Nations - with its -year experience in preserving peace and nurturing friendly, just and equitable international relations - continues to assert its key role in the multilateral system. The Organization continues to effectively coordinate global efforts to respond to global challenges that cannot be resolved by any one country acting alone. Against  such  backdrop,  I  fully  support  the  theme  proposed  by  Mr. President. And let me share some of my thoughts.  First, our most urgent task today is to expeditiously contain COVID- worldwide. The world cannot be safe if any single person or country still suffers from this pandemic. Viet Nam  values  the role  of UN agencies  and in the  COVAX  Facility other  multilateral promoting  fair  and  equitable  access to  COVID-  vaccines  and medications.  institutions,  particularly For  the  pandemic  to  be  repelled,  it  is  essential  that  we  stand  in solidarity,  uphold  a  high  sense  of  responsibility,  and  step  up  cooperation. Particularly, priority allocation of vaccines should be given to nations with a  low  vaccination  rate.  And  developing  countries  should  be  enabled  to engage in vaccine production and supply chains.     Second, the key solution to contain the pandemic and foster economic recovery lies in our ability to strengthen our own resilience, particularly in face  of    crises.  But  this  does  not  mean  that  we  have  to  do  it  alone. Resilience  can  only  be  sustained  if  it  is  based  upon  cooperation  and connectivity  among  nations,  particularly  at  a  time  when  non-traditional security challenges do not know borders and can impact any nation.  We  value  the  role  played  by  the  UN  system  and  expect  that  it  will resilience, continue accommodating the interests and concerns of all countries. to  support  member  states’  efforts to  build Third,  the  challenges  we  face  can  be  turned  into  development opportunities.  As  our  daily  lives  as  well  as  production  and  business activities  have  to  undergo  changes  to  adapt  to  the  pandemic,  this  is  an opportunity for digital transformation, utilization of novel technologies, and enhanced productivity, competitiveness and self-reliance of our economies.  It is  also  a  chance  for  us  to  pursue  green  transformation,  sustainable development,  trade  and  investment  facilitation.  We  should  also  work together in promoting the flow of goods and people and maintaining global supply chains.  The  2030  Agenda  for  Sustainable  Development  provides  us  with  an excellent  blueprint  for  seizing  such  opportunities,  and  calls  for  enhanced cooperation.  We  call  upon  all  countries  to  fulfill  their  financing  for development  commitments,  reschedule  debt  payments  by  developing countries,  and  provide  these  countries  with  necessary  resources  to  contain COVID- and foster recovery, thereby turning opportunities into concrete development outcomes.  Fourth,  cooperation  in  mitigating  and  preventing  the  dire  impacts  of climate change has become more crucial than ever before. Harsh weather conditions,  sea  level  rise,  environmental  pollution,  and  biodiversity degradation  are  the  cumulative  consequences  of  decades  of  mankind’s reckless quest for development.     Those challenges are pushing us into acting promptly to safeguard our planet  and  realize  the  internationally  agreed  threshold  of  .  degrees Celsius.  As we are heading toward COP-, we need to make every effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions, in which developed countries should take the lead.  Developing  countries  should  receive  further  assistance  in  financing, technology  transfer  and  capacity-building  so  as  to  reduce  emissions,  and enhance  disaster  prevention  and  mitigation  in  ways  that  foster  transition towards green and circular economy. This is a shared opportunity for us to ensure the harmony between man and nature.  Fifth,  the  pre-requisite  to  fostering  recovery  and  growth  in  the  post-pandemic  era  is  to  sustain  peace,  security,  and  stability  in  each  country, each  region,  and  the  world  at  large.  Viet  Nam  calls  for  a  global  ceasefire and  an  end  to  all  violence  to  ensure  the  safety  of  civilians  and  facilitate humanitarian assistance in areas of conflicts.  national reunification, Viet  Nam  has  undergone  decades  of  wars  to  reclaim  independence embargoes.  and escape We have made every effort to mobilize our internal strengths, uphold self-reliance, and adapt ourselves to the prevailing trends of our time to achieve our potential, international standing and prestige today.  isolation and We understand thoroughly the meaning of “nothing is more precious than  independence  and  freedom,”  and  of  peace  and  development  of  each nation.  Viet  Nam  condemns  all  acts  of  war  and  power  politics,  and violations of the fundamental principles of the UN Charter and international law.  More than ever before, all actors in international relations need to act in  good  faith  and  uphold  responsibility,  while  avoiding  tensions  and confrontation.  We  should  together  strive  to  reshape  international  ties  and build  trust  among  countries  on  the  basis  of  equality  and  cooperation.  We must  also  respect  the  independence,  sovereignty,  territorial  integrity,  non-   interference  in  the  internal  affairs  of  States,  and  resolve  disputes  by peaceful means.  At  this  august  forum,  we  once  again  reaffirm  our  solidarity  with  the people  of  Cuba,  and  reiterate  our  strong  call  for  a  complete  end  to  the unilateral embargoes against Cuba.   We  hope  that  the  situation  in  Afghanistan  will  soon  stabilize  for  the Afghan people, particularly women and children, to be able to live in peace. We  support  the  just  struggle  of  the  Palestinian  people  and  the  two-state solution  towards  the  establishment  of  an  independent  Palestinian  State living in peace alongside the State of Israel. Mr. President, After    years  of  Doi  Moi,  Viet  Nam  has  made  historic accomplishments.  We  are  aiming  to  become  a  high-income  developed country by 2045, on the centenary anniversary of Viet Nam’s independence.  The aspiration for a strong and prosperous Viet Nam can only be realized when the country is truly a law-governed state of the people, for the people and by the people, and is able to invoke the patriotism, perseverance, great national solidarity and innovation of the entire nation.  Viet Nam is pursuing a people-centered approach, and is striving to achieve  social  progress  and  equality,  preserve  cultural  values,  and  protect the  environment,  while  promoting  sustainable  and  inclusive  development. This is closely aligned with the SDGs that we endeavor to fulfill.  friendship, Viet  Nam  has  been  pursuing  a  foreign  policy  of  independence,  self-reliance,  peace, and cooperation diversification and multilateralization of external relations. As a responsible member  of  the  international  community,  Viet  Nam  is  proactively  and actively engaged in extensive international integration, making responsible contributions to the concerted efforts of the international community. and  development, Viet Nam wholeheartedly support multilateralism, with the UN at the center,  and  international  law  as  the  foundation.  We  uphold  the  purposes    and  principles  of  the  UN  Charter,  and  endeavor  to  make  substantial contributions to a more democratic and effective UN. We will always remember and treasure the UN’s invaluable assistance accorded to Viet Nam. The fruits of Viet Nam’s reform and integration owe partly  to  the  resources  and  policy  advice  the  UN  development  system  has been rendering to us over the years.  In  the  region,  Viet  Nam  is  working  closely  with  fellow  ASEAN members  to  promote  ASEAN  centrality  in  the  maintenance  of  peace, security and prosperity in Southeast Asia and the Asia-Pacific at large.  The  ASEAN  -  UN  relations  has  constantly  been  consolidated  and developed,  becoming  a  role  model  for  cooperation  between  the  UN  and other regional organizations. We are making vigorous efforts to implement the Five-point Consensus endorsed by ASEAN Leaders to foster dialogue, reconciliation, and humanitarian assistance to the people of Myanmar. the Viet  Nam  shares  ASEAN’s  position  and international community’s common voice on the importance of peace, stability, maritime security  and  safety,  freedom  of  navigation  and  overflight  in  the  South China Sea. We believe that all parties should refrain from unilateral actions that  may  further  complicate  the  situation,  resolve  disputes  and  differences through peaceful means in line with the UN Charter and international law, particularly  UNCLOS  1982.  It  is  also  necessary  to  fully  observe  the Declaration of Conduct by parties in the South China Sea, and soon achieve a substantial and effective Code of Conduct in line with international law, including UNCLOS 1982.  Mr. President, On this momentous occasion, on behalf of the State and people of Viet Nam,  I  sincerely  thank  all  member  countries  for  the  trust  placed  in  Viet Nam in its capacity as a non-permanent member of the UNSC for the term 2020-2021.  Over  the  past  almost  two  years,  Viet  Nam  has  always  upheld the  principle  of  “Partnership  for  sustainable  peace.”  We  have  promoted dialogue  and  cooperation,  and  actively  joined  the  concerted  efforts  to    prevent  and  address  conflicts.  Viet  Nam  has  advocated  strengthening  the upholding of the UN Charter  and international law, bolstering cooperation with  regional  organizations,  conflict  prevention,  mine  action,  and    the protection of civilians and civilian critical infrastructure in armed conflicts.  The national flag of Viet Nam is flying high at the UN Peacekeeping Missions in South Sudan and the Central African Republic, and it will soon be  flying  in  other  UN  Missions  as  well.  With  our  desire  to  make  further contributions to the work at the UN, Viet Nam is running for a seat at the Human Rights Council for the term 2023-2025, and at other important UN agencies.  We  look  forward  to  the  continued  support  from  all  countries  in this endeavor.  Mr. President The  path  ahead  will  not  be  easy.  But  I  am  convinced  that  the  world people’s  hearts  will  beat  as  one.  Viet  Nam  will  work  with  countries  and people around the world so that together we can prevail over the pandemic, and build a world of peace, prosperity and happiness for all. And this will be a glorious victory for us all.  Thank you.     "
60,2021,BGD,Bangladesh,"President, Assalamu Alaikum. I congratulate you on your election as the President of the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly. We have confidence in your ‘Presidency of Hope’ to steer us through a sustainable recovery that leaves no one behind.  I  also  congratulate  Mr.  Volkan  BOZKIR,  the  preceding  President,  for  his leadership in the face of unprecedented challenges during the historic 75th Session of the General Assembly. It’s my great pride that this is my 17th participation in the UNGA to represent my country, Bangladesh. This 76th UNGA comes at a time when COVID- is claiming lives across the globe. Many countries are being affected by recurring waves of new variants. The pandemic has battered the health systems and economies across the world. I pay tribute to all the frontline workers, for their dedicated service and sacrifice during this crisis. Against the grim reality of COVID , the theme of this session centering around ‘hope’, is very timely.  As  an  avowed  supporter  of  multilateralism  and  the  UN  system,  Bangladesh wishes to see this organization as a source of hope and aspiration during this critical time. We must set aside our differences and rise  as one harnessing our collective strength to build back a better world for all. Page  of          Mr. President, This  is  a  very  special  year  for  us.    This  year  we  are  celebrating  the  golden jubilee of our independence. This celebration coincides with ‘Mujib Year’, the Birth Centenary of our Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.  I  pay  my  profound  respect  and  homage  to  the  Father  of  our  Nation Bangabandhu  Sheikh  Mujibur  Rahman,  whose  selfless,  lifelong  struggle  and visionary  leadership  brought  us  our  long-cherished  Independence.  I  also  pay  my deepest tribute to the valiant freedom fighters for their courage and sacrifices to free our motherland. Our Father of the Nation was a strong advocate of multilateralism and called the United Nations ‘as the center of people’s future hopes and aspirations.’ On the very first day of our journey in the United Nations, he had said, and I quote from his maiden speech to the UNGA on 25th September 1974: “Our goal is self-reliance; our chosen path is the united and collective efforts of our people. International cooperation and the sharing of the resources and technology could, no doubt, make our task less onerous and reduce the cost in human suffering”.  He called for building a world free of economic inequalities, social injustice, aggression,  and  threats  of  nuclear  war.  These  are  as  relevant  today  as  they  were forty-seven years ago. As such, we continue to lend our voice and leadership to all those issues that aim at building an inclusive and equal society. Our calls for vaccine equality, our firm position against any form of injustice as against the Palestinian people, resolution of the Rohingya crisis, and promoting climate justice – are a few examples of our global commitment. Page  of         We have been working hard to fulfill the unfinished dream of our Father of the Nation. We are now among the five fastest growing economies in the world, ranking 41st in terms of GDP. Over the past decade, we have reduced the poverty rate from . per cent to . per cent. Our per capita income jumped to more than threefold in  just  one  decade  to  twenty-two  hundred    US  dollars.  Our  foreign  currency reserve has reached all time high to  billion dollars. Bangladesh  has  made  impressive  progress  in  socio-economic  sphere  and women  empowerment  during  last  decade.  The  infant  mortality  rate  has  been reduced to . per one thousand; maternal mortality rate to 173 per one hundred thousand live births; and the average longevity of people rose to  years.  According  to  World  Economic  Forum,  in  political  empowerment  of  women Bangladesh is ranked 7th; ahead of its regional neighbors since 2014.  Our ‘Digital Bangladesh’ initiative has stimulated transformative impacts on socio-economic  development,  education,  disaster  risk  reduction,  women’s empowerment, and so on. Our social safety net programs have also made significant expansion.  As  for  SDG  Index  Score,  the  Sustainable  Development  Report  2021 identified Bangladesh as having progressed the most since 2015. Such progress was due  to  heavy  investment  in  women’s  advancement  and  empowerment,  which contributed to our transformative development. We have achieved the milestone of LDC graduation this year. Our vision is to transform Bangladesh into a knowledge-based developed country by  2041; and a prosperous and resilient Delta by 2100.  Mr. President, Page  of         The  Covid-’s  impact  on  Bangladesh  has  been  much  less  than  feared.  It  is mainly  because  of  our  healthcare  system  that  has  been  strengthened  from  the grassroots  level.  Besides,  we  adopted  a  timely  multi-pronged,  multi-stakeholder approach  to  tackle  its  challenges.  From  the  very  beginning,  we  took  some  firm decisions  to  balance  between  life  and  livelihood.  They  included    stimulus packages to the tune of . billion US dollars or . per cent of our GDP to keep our  economy  afloat.  We  also  allocated  .  billion  US  dollars  for  vaccines  in  the current budget cycle. Notably,  we  gave  serious  attention  to  the  most  vulnerable  sections  of  our society  like  the  ultra-poor,  disabled,  elders,  returnee  migrants  and  vulnerable women. At the outbreak of the pandemic last year, we immediately distributed cash and  other  kinds  of  assistance  to  nearly    million  people.  Our  well-timed intervention and our people’s resilience helped us achieve over  per cent economic growth in 2020. Mr. President, Humanity,  since  time  immemorial,  has  faced  the  onslaughts  of  nature  and pestilence, as well as manmade conflicts and disasters. Yet humanity has survived these monumental challenges with hope in their hearts and belief in themselves.  This  pandemic  is  another  such  crisis  from  which  many  inspiring  stories  of human survival and magnanimity have been born. Sadly though, this malaise seems likely to be here for a while, and therefore, as we have in the past must come forth with fresh, inclusive, and global ideas to fight this common enemy. Let me highlight a few specific issues in this regard. Page  of        First, for a COVID-free world, we must ensure universal and affordable access to  vaccines  for  people  across  the  world.  In  the  last  UNGA,  I  urged  this  august assembly to treat COVID- vaccines as a ‘global public good.’ This was echoed by many other leaders. Yet these calls remain largely unheeded. Instead, we have seen growing ‘vaccines divides’ between the rich and the poor nations. According to the World Bank,  percent of vaccine doses have so far gone to people in high and upper middle-income countries, while the low-income countries received less than  percent. This vaccine inequality must be  addressed urgently. We cannot chart out a sustainable recovery and be safe by leaving millions behind.  Therefore,  I  reiterate  my  call  to  ensure  equitable  and  affordable  access  to vaccine  for  all.  Immediate  transfer  of  vaccine  technologies  could  be  a  means  to ensure  vaccine  equity.  Bangladesh  is  ready  to  produce  vaccines  in  mass  scale  if technical know-how is shared with us and patent waiver is granted. Second, the pandemic has disproportionately impacted the climate vulnerable countries. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Working Group-I Report provided a grim scenario of our planet.  Unless  there  are  immediate  measures,  the  devastating  impacts  of  climate change will be irreversible. No country, rich or poor, is immune of the destructive effects.  We,  therefore,  call  upon  the  rich  and  industrialized  countries  to  cut emissions, compensate for the loss and damage, and ensure adequate financing and technology transfer for adaptation and resilience building. As  the  Chair  of  the  Climate  Vulnerable  Forum  and  the  Vulnerable  Twenty Group of Ministers of Finance, we have launched the “Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan –  Decade  2030”  outlining  a  transformative  agenda  from  climate  vulnerability  to climate prosperity.   The  upcoming  COP-  Summit  in  Glasgow  provides  us  with  a  good opportunity to rally support for such new and inclusive ideas. Let us not miss out on this opportunity.  Page  of     Third, the pandemic has severely disrupted our education system. According to UNICEF, close to half the world’s students were affected by partial or full school closures. Millions of students in low-income countries did not have the resources and technologies to join remote learning facilities, jeopardizing decades of gains in enrollment, literacy rates, etc.  We need a global plan to prioritize education recovery by investing in digital tools and services, access to internet, and capacity building of teachers.  We also call the UN system to rally partnership and resources to make that happen. Fourth, despite the unprecedented challenges by the COVID- pandemic, we are  on  the  track  to  graduate  from  the  LDC  category.  The  COVID-  pandemic, however, has put at risk the graduation prospect and aspiration of many countries. To motivate and incentivize sustainable graduation, we look forward to receiving more  support  from  our  development  partners  for  an  incentive-based  graduation structure.  As  one  of  the  co-chairs  of  the  Preparatory  Committee  of  the  LDC   Conference,  we  expect  concrete  outcome  of  Doha  conference  enabling  more countries to sustainably graduate out of the LDC category.  Fifth, migrants have been the frontline contributors during the pandemic as essential  workers  in  the  health  and  other  emergency  services.  Yet  many  of  them have been particularly hard-hit due to loss of jobs, salary cuts, lack of access to health and  other  social  services,  and  forcible  return.  We  urge  the  migrant  receiving countries to treat them fairly and protect their job, health, and well-being during this trying time.  Sixth,  the  Rohingya  crisis  is  in  its  fifth  year  now.  Yet  not  a  single  Forcibly displaced  Myanmar  National  could  be  repatriated  to  Myanmar.  Despite  the uncertainty  created  by  the  recent  political  developments  in  Myanmar,  we  expect enhanced focus and active support of the international community to find a durable Page  of       solution  to  this  crisis.  Myanmar  must  create  the  conditions  conducive  for  their return. We are ready to work with the international community on this compelling priority.  On our part, to ensure their temporary stay in Bangladesh we have relocated some of the Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals (Rohingya) to ‘Bashan Char’. We have also included all eligible from them in the national vaccination drive to curb the spread of COVID- in the camps. I would like to reiterate that the crisis was created in Myanmar and its solution lies in Myanmar.  International community must work constructively for a permanent solution of the crisis through safe, sustainable, and dignified return of the Rohingyas to their home in the Rakhine State. While we expect the ASEAN leadership to step up their ongoing efforts, the international community needs to support all the accountability processes.  Mr. President,  We envision a peaceful, stable, and prosperous South Asia. We firmly believe that  it  is  upon  the  people  of  Afghanistan  to  rebuild  their  country  and  decide  the course of the future themselves. Bangladesh stands ready to continue to work with the people of Afghanistan and the international community for its socio-economic development.  Peace remains a pre-eminent focus of our foreign policy. As a proponent of the flagship resolution on Culture of Peace, we remain deeply committed to creating a peaceful society. The menace of terrorism and violent extremism are jeopardizing peace  and  security  in  many  parts  of  the  world.  Therefore,  we  maintain  a  “zero tolerance policy” towards these menaces.  Page  of       Today,  we  take  pride  as  the  leading  peacekeeping  nation  and  for  our contribution to global peace. Despite unprecedented challenges of the pandemic, our peacekeepers  are  serving  in  some  of  the  most  difficult  circumstances  across  the globe  with  utmost  dedication  and  professionalism.  The  international  community must do everything possible to ensure their safety and security.  As  per  our  constitutional  obligation,  we  have  always  been  a  steadfast supporter of complete disarmament.  We  firmly  believe  that  the  ultimate  guarantee  of  international  peace  and security lies in the total elimination of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. It was from that conviction we ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of nuclear weapons (TPNW), which entered into force earlier this year.  Mr. President, The Covid- has brought to the fore the inadequacy of the global response to tackle  emergencies. It  has  also  put  a  spotlight  on  the  critical  need  for  global solidarity and collaboration to effective Covid- response. We must demonstrate our ability to work and act together on global common issues and create space for new partnerships and solutions. And that must start right here at the UN; with the member states; across regions; rising above narrow political interests. Only then can we pursue any meaningful collaboration towards a resilient and inclusive recovery.  At this critical juncture, the United Nations stands as our best hope.  Page  of          Let us join our hands together to keep that hope alive. Before I conclude, I wish to humbly remind this revered body established to ensure  peace  and  justice  around  the  world  that  I  am  still  seeking  justice  for  the brutal  massacre  of  my  family  that  took  place    years  ago.  It  was  early  in  the morning of August , 1975, a band of renegade killers ruthlessly assassinated my father, the Father of the Nation and the then President of Bangladesh, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, my loving mother, Sheikh Fazilutunnesa Mujib, my three brothers Freedom Fighter Captain Sheikh Kamal, Freedom Fighter Lt. Sheikh Jamal, -years old Sheikh Russell and paternal uncle Freedom Fighter Sheikh Abu Naser. Eighteen of my close family members were brutally murdered. My younger sister, Sheikh Rehana and I survived the carnage as we were abroad at the time. For  years we were on exile suffering from the agony of losing near and dear ones.  Nevertheless, my struggle continued and upon returning to Bangladesh, I have devoted  my  life  to  fulfilling  the  dream  of  my  father,  Father  of  the  Nation Bangabandhu  Sheikh  Mujibur  Rahman  for  a  happy  and  prosperous  Golden Bangladesh. I shall continue to do so as long as I live, Insha Allah. Thank you all once again. Khoda Hafez. Joi Bangla, Joi Bangabandhu May Bangladesh Live-forever. Page  of       "
61,2021,BTN,Bhutan,"President,  Secretary General, Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates, . . . . . . I bring you warm greetings from His Majesty  The King, Her Majesty The Queen and the people of Bhutan, the land of Gross National Happiness.  I  begin  with  prayers  for  all  the  precious  lives  lost  to  the  pandemic  and sincerely hope it comes to an end very soon. (pause) Congratulations Your Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid for the presidentship. I assure you my full support as you assume this role at a critical time. I also extend  my  gratitude  to  the  75th  President  for  conducting  the  last  session successfully.  I  take  this  opportunity  to  congratulate  Your  Excellency  Mr.  Antonio Guterres, on your re-election as the Secretary General of the United Nations. Nobody else can give us better hope and guidance to build back from this pandemic than Your Excellency.  I would also like to thank Your Excellency as well as Prime Minister Johnson for organising the Leaders Roundtable on Climate Change five days ago. I spoke  on  behalf  of  the    LDCs  and  we  are  already  excited  for  concrete results out of the COP26 in the coming month.  I  would  like  to  inform  the  august  gathering  that  this  year  marks  the  50th anniversary of Bhutan’s membership to the UN. I was excited to attend the session and celebrate the milestone with you all, but the situation as you know did not favour our physical participation.          . I  thank  everyone  at  the  organization  and  all  the  members  for  enriching Bhutan’s five decades of journey with the UN. .  We have come a long way. The fact that we are ready to graduate from the LDC category is a clear indication that our efforts together have born results. . In addition to the UN and other partners, I thank the Government of India for your unconditional support all these years. .  We will continue to work closely with all our partners. . Please allow me to talk a little more on the last five decades.  .  During the  years, the global poverty rate dropped from  to  percent. Life expectancy increased from  to almost  years. Bhutan’s was just  when we joined the UN. The infant mortality rate decreased from  to  deaths per 1000 live births.  . . . Similarly, the maternal mortality reduced from almost 400 to 200 deaths per 100,000 live births. The global literacy rate spiked from  to  percent.  Without  the  coordinated  global  efforts  through  the  UN,  these  progresses would  not  have  been  possible  or  worse,  many  nations  could  have  slipped backwards. We are thankful that Bhutan has comparatively benefitted more.    In the last  years, Bhutan was blessed with three successive monarchs.   It  was  His  Late  Majesty  the  Third  King  who  worked  tirelessly  to  install Bhutan into the UN. It was a historic move to establish global diplomacy and harness meaningful friendship. The farsighted monarch led the country on the path of modernization, with focus on modern education and progressive techniques in all spheres. .  When  the  Fourth  King  took  over  soon  after,  he  came  with  the  profound development philosophy of Gross National Happiness in as early as 1972.            As  the  term  “GNH”  became  more  pronounced  over  the  years,  the  world appreciated its relevance in the sustainable and holistic format as opposed to the conventional GDP growth.  I  am  happy  to  see  this  concept  reflected  in  Secretary  General’s  “Our Common Agenda” report, which I would like to touch upon later.  .  The nation lived through major socio-economic development, championing in  conservation efforts  and strengthening  global  ties.  The  world will  recall that during the peak of his reign, our fourth King stepped down to offer the throne  to  his  son  and  despite  public  resistance,  he  ushered  in  democratic transition.  .  Destined to carry forward the legacy, Bhutan received a young and dynamic monarch, His Majesty The King, in 2006. We embarked on a new chapter. Just under two decades, people of Bhutan relished the reign of a King who was caring, learned and astute.  . . . For generations, Bhutanese have always loved and revered our Kings… for the simple reason that our monarchs have been selfless for the nation and the people. But when COVID- crisis unfolded, for Bhutan, we uncovered the true essence of our King’s leadership. In  him,  we  saw  a  son  who  ensured  the  old  and  vulnerable  people  were protected from the infection. In him, we saw a brother who travelled tirelessly throughout the country, uplifting the spirits of the front-liners, and working alongside to protect the people.  In  His  Majesty,  we  saw  a  parent  who  ensured  the  livelihoods  of  all  those affected. The supports ranged from emotional to cash to food. But of all, we saw a noble being who led with science and wisdom on one hand and care and compassion on the other. .  Complementing  all  the  noble  efforts,  Her  Majesty  The  Queen  showed personal care and initiated targeted inventions for the vulnerable sections of our society with emphasis on mental health care and services in the country.        .  When the world was dealing with the unprecedented plight that questioned our survival and livelihood daily, we sailed through with a minimum scratch from the pandemic. To update, we have seen only three COVID deaths and slightly over ,500 cases so far, most of which were imported cases.  . Similarly,  our  vaccination  coverage  for    years  and  above  is  almost   percent,  as  I  speak. Despite  being  resource  constraint,  we  have  not compromised on the quality and standards of the COVID measures.  .  Let me also mention that in the entire process of battling the pandemic, we ensured the routine health services were delivered uninterrupted. Besides the regular vaccination programs, we introduced HPV vaccines for the first time for our boys and flu shots for everyone amid the pandemic.  .  We also launched nationwide program on prevention and early detection of the three most common cancers in Bhutan-stomach, breast and cervical.  .  All these are aligned with the royal visions enshrined in the Constitution that mandates the State to provide free health and education. His Majesty tells us that quality health and education, made affordable and available to all, are the biggest social levellers.  Excellencies,  . Just  like  the  rest  of  the  world,  we  are  also  looking  at  the  pandemic  as  an opportunity to reset ourselves. The process to overhaul the civil service in consonance  with  education  reform  is  underway.  This  is  an  unprecedented move.  A nationwide roll-out of Bhutan baccalaureate system is in progress following successful trial of a formative education system in the last ten years. .  Knowing that the path ahead is ICT driven, we have started digital initiatives with the ultimate goal for everyone in Bhutan to have a digital ID, as a build-up for Big Data system.         . Some  other  components  are  ICTisation  of  schools, Integrated  Taxation System, and electronic Patient Information management.  On  the  other  hand,  our  Central  Bank  is  also  piloting  a  project  on  digital Ngultrum, Bhutan’s currency, using block chain technology. This is to adapt with  the  overall  ICT  transformation  and  harness  technology  for  a  21st century Bhutan.  .  Here, let me share that it is as though His Majesty saw the pandemic coming. In 2011, an extensive program that engaged citizens in a greater role of nation building, calling it De-Suung, the Guardians of Peace, was started.  . It recharged the entire spirit of volunteerism, opened world of opportunities for our youth and injected sense of purpose and responsibility. Thousands of youth were involved in the programs that created a mass societal shift. .  When disease entered the country, the De-Suups in their orange uniform were helping guard the borders and entry points, ensuring everyone followed the COVID- norms and even became a part of the paramedics. This made a huge impact in efficient management of the pandemic.  . In  another  unique  transformative  step,  the  De-Suups  when  not  a  part  of COVID-  related  duties,  are  engaged  in  various  skilling  and  re-skilling programs across the nation.  .  We know that the pandemic has forced many out of jobs and their basic skills have become irrelevant.  The ILO projects the global shortfall of jobs to be  million this year and  million in 2022.  This means unless we re-tool ourselves in keeping with the change, it will be difficult to find gainful employment and other opportunities for many. .  The ongoing youth engagement programs are major steps to recover from the pandemic.         While the effects may not be immediate, down the years, it would have been one of the main reasons for us to come out of the pandemic stronger.  . . I feel when Bhutan’s socio-economic  transformation is reviewed later, our human development initiatives, guided by our King, will be the chapter that would have truly steered our nation into the 21st century.  I am highly appreciative of the fact that the UN instruments are sensitive in picking  this  up.  A  special  recognition  was  awarded  to  His  Majesty  for  his leadership in advancing human development and the wellbeing of Bhutanese people in 2019.  Excellencies,  .  We have immense lessons to draw from the pandemic, be it at national or global level. It has uncovered weaknesses and potentials of many nations and societies. But one lesson that we all must keep in mind is to be prepared with a more resilient system for future.  .  The nomenclature of SARS-CoV- and COVID- clearly indicate that there will be successive outbreaks of infectious diseases. It is a matter of when. I mean nobody knows where SARS-CoV- is getting incubated.  .  Therefore,  our  focus  to  build  back  better  can  never  be  good  if  we  don’t emphasise  on  health  and  quality  healthcare  that  is  easily  accessible  and affordable by everyone.  .  We must also be mindful that immediate disease outbreak could be potentially from  the  pandemic  induced  starvation  and  poverty.  The  pandemic  has disrupted the already weak global food system. The Asia-Pacific region alone has  million people pushed back into extreme poverty in the aftermath of the current health crisis.         . I  shared  my  concern  during  the  UN  food  system  summit  the  day  before. Forget  meeting  the  nutritional  requirements,  we  are  struggling  to  ensure adequate quantity.  We must coordinate clear action plans to meet the immediate food shortage and long term sustenance plan. . In all the discussions about food security, one immediate challenge besides the pandemic is the climate change that has tested the resilience of the food we grow as well as the patience of the growers.  .  Which  is  why  it  is  time  for  action  now. On  Bhutan’s  part,  our  visionary monarchs  have  maintained  high  legal  standards  to  safeguard  our  natural heritage.   .  We  have  a  dedicated  chapter  on  environment  in  our  Constitution,  which mandates % forest coverage and maintain inter-generational equity of our natural resources.  .  We have more than half the country as protected areas. In order to safeguard the health of the protected areas, and the livelihood of people living there, a Royal Charter was issued for an innovative funding mechanism called Bhutan for Life. We consider these as our eternal NDCs from Bhutan.  . If we mean what we say about working for the next generation, we must talk about tough climate laws as a component of NDCs from all countries. Excellencies  .  Despite  being  a  small  developing  nation,  as  a  GNH  country,  we  always believe  in  global  peace  and  harmony.  Bhutan  joined  the  peacekeeping fraternity in 2014. Since then, our involvement with UN Peace Keeping has grown.           .  We are now set to deploy a Bhutanese Quick Reaction Force for the first time this year. I thank the UN for trusting us. I am confident that our troops will live up to His Majesty’s aspirations of serving with distinction and honour.  . . In  conclusion,  we  all  know  that  COVID-  will  leave  behind  a  different world. But what sort of a world we want lies in our hands.  Mr. Secretary General’s report titled “Our Common Agenda” offers all of us a good reference point for our collective progress.  For  this,  I  thank  the  Secretary  General  for  coming  out  with  this comprehensive and bold report for a greener and safer world. Please know that Bhutan is committed to working with other Member States in advancing the  ideas  in  the  report.  We  have  full  confidence  in  your  leadership  to spearhead Our Common Agenda. . I want to share that it was almost as if the theme of the general debate was designed for Bhutan. It gave me an opportunity to reflect on our hope as a nation.  .  The pandemic brought out the very essence of GNH, which seeks collective happiness and not just of oneself. It calls for us to act in unity.  . For Bhutan, everyone came forward to show solidarity to shield our country from the pandemic under His Majesty’s leadership. If not, this small, resource constraint country would have been crushed in the stampede of the COVID- pandemic. .  Our  unique  system  is  beyond  conventional  definition  of  progress  and prosperity. A country’s future is not just founded based on economic might and technological advancements but on the integral values of human bonding and respect. And in this, His Majesty is our true hope and our future.  . I feel this is our biggest strength to come out of any adversities, just as we did this time.          .  With prayers from Bhutan to the rest of the world I thank you all for listening. I wish the 76th session of the UN General Assembly every success. Thank you and Tashi Delek.      "
62,2021,IRN,Iran (Islamic Republic of),"President; I have taken the floor to respond to the baseless allegations made today by the Prime Minister of the Israeli regime. Like his notorious predecessor, in his statement, he tried his best to disseminate as much disinformation and make as many unfounded allegations against my country as he could. He played the victim and desperately tried to portray the Israeli regime as innocent.   It is not surprising at all. Deception has always been part of their agenda.  His  mischievous  objective  is  crystal  clear:  to  cover  up  all  expansionist  and destabilizing policies and criminal practices of the Zionist regime in the region over the past seven decades. Instead of such fabrications and accusations, he must have said that as the only occupying power in the region, it has waged over  wars, invaded not only all its neighbors without exception but even countries beyond the region, continued to occupy some territories, and committed all four core international crimes, not once but repeatedly and sometimes simultaneously. And this long dark record goes on and on.      He did not even refer once to the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people who continue to live for well over seven decades under occupation and brutal rule of the Israeli regime. He  did  not  also  make  any  reference  to  unlawful  and  inhumane  blockade  it  has imposed to the Gaza Strip, changing it to the world’s largest open-air prison. He also deceptively tried to portray his regime as the only democracy in the region, without mentioning that its rulers have always been engaged in terrorist activities and some of them are well-known for being the butchers of innocent Palestinian civilians.  For example, only in its -day brutal and all-out war on Gaza in May 2021, Israeli forces killed 256 Palestinians, including  children and  women. This included  members of an extended family who were killed and buried in the rubble of their own home -- many of whom were children, one as young as six months. The best designation for the rulers of the Israeli regime is the child-killer terrorists. He must have also explained that why it still continues confiscation and demolition of Palestinian homes, forced displacement of their inhabitants, and killing peaceful Palestinian protestors. All  policies  and  practices  of  this  brutal  regime  have  been  and  continue  to  be  in flagrant  violation  of  the  basic  principles  of  morality  and  humanity  and  rules  of international law, particularly international humanitarian law. This  regime  cannot  deflect  attentions  from long-standing  malign  and destabilizing activities in the region by waging a widespread systematic Iranophobic campaign, like what he said regarding our peaceful nuclear program. its Possessing  all  types  of  weapons  of  mass  destruction,  as  well  as  the  most sophisticated  conventional  weapons,  the  Israeli  regime  continues  to  endanger peace and security in the region and beyond. It also brazenly defies constant strong international calls to join international legally binding instruments banning weapons of mass destruction.  As such, it continues seriously hampering the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East – proposed by Iran in 1974.  Yet, it desperately attempts to portray Iran’s conventional weapon capabilities or its  exclusively  peaceful  nuclear  program,  which  is  under  the  most  robust verification of the International Atomic Energy Agency, as a challenge to regional stability.  This is but a hypocritical move to distract attention from the real danger posed to regional peace and security by this regime, particularly its nuclear-weapon arsenals and clandestine and unsafeguarded nuclear installations and activities. Rejecting all principles governing this Organization, including this august Assembly, he used once again threatening language against my country in flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter.  He  should  have  no  illusion  about  our  ability  and  determination  to  defend  our security and interests. His regime must avoid any miscalculation and adventuristic move in the region. We have demonstrated that we do not hesitate to exercise our inherent right to defend ourselves against any threat and at any time.  My  delegation  categorically  rejects  all  baseless  allegations  made  by  the  Israeli regime against my country including our President. Mr. President; While I have the floor, I would like to respond to the unfounded claims made by the representative of United Arab Emirates against the territorial integrity of my country over the Iranian islands of Abu Musa, Lesser Tunb and Greater Tunb. T he Islamic Republic of Iran reiterates its consistent and principled position that it does not recognize the existence of any such dispute between Iran and UAE.  The three islands have been an inseparable part of Iranian territory and, therefore, any claim to the contrary is categorically rejected.  Nonetheless,  and  to  show its  utmost  respect  for  the  principle  of  good neighborliness,  Iran  has  always  expressed  its  readiness  to  talk  with  the  UAE bilaterally with a view to removing any misunderstanding that may exist on the part of the UAE over Abu Musa Island. The representative of the United Arab Emirates should also be reminded that the term “Persian Gulf” has been the correct appellation for the body of water situated between  the  Arabian  Peninsula  and  the  Iranian  plateau  since  500  B.C.,  and  will remain so forever. I thank you, Mr. President. "
63,2021,MDV,Maldives,"President of the Republic of Maldives, at the General Debate of the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly  September 2021 Bismilliah ah Rahmaan ah Raheem. Mr.  President,  Mr.  Secretary-General,  Distinguished Guests; . It is my singular honour to offer on behalf of a proud nation, our congratulations and felicitations to His Excellency  Abdulla  Shahid  on  his  election  as President  of  the  76th  session  of  the  General Assembly.  I  also  wish  to  extend  to  you,  Mr. Secretary-General  our  hearty  congratulations  on your reappointment.  Mr. President; .   years  ago,  right  after  our  independence,  we made  haste  to  seek  membership  at  the  United Nations. But our entry was not guaranteed. It was the  age  of  decolonization.  The  age  of  self-determination when numerous new nations came           into existence. It was an age when humanity shook off  the  shackles  of  the  past  for  the  sake  of civilisation  and  progress.  The  story  goes  that  the matter  of  allowing  entry  to  small  states  such  as ourselves was furiously debated - whether a small island would qualify to meaningfully contribute to world  affairs.  Today,    years  since  then,  as President of the Republic of Maldives, I address the presidency of this General Assembly in our mother tongue. Our mother tongue, Dhivehi, the language we  take  pride  in  and  is  close  to  our  hearts.  A language that is most familiar for the Presidency of this General Assembly. The Maldives may be small in  size.  Maldivians,  however,  are  big  in  their  rich culture and heritage. This is indeed a great honour for our nation.  Mr. President; . It is highly apropos that your tenure at the helm of this  great  assembly  is  entitled  the  “Presidency  of Hope.”  Because,  for  certain,  hope  is  a  highly desirable  commodity  in  these  difficult  times,  and surely  what  led  to  the  formation  of  the  United Nations.  It  was  hope  for  a  world  devoid  of  the ugliness of wars and famine; hope for equality of all peoples to prevail; hope for justice, human rights,      to self-determination  and  democracy reign supreme; hope of a world where people oppressed under the yoke of colonial rule and other forms of oppression  were  rendered  free;  hope  that  we preserve our planet, its resources, ecosystems and wonders for generations yet to be born.  Mr. President; . For the past  years, every year, we gather in this great hall and give speeches that inspire us to scale seemingly  insurmountable  odds  to  resolve  the various problems that afflict our global community. Yet,  for  all  our  achievements  and  success,  the Covid-  pandemic  has  pushed  our  progress  back years.  The  adverse  impacts  of  climate  change  are increasing.  The  steady  growth  of  the  world’s population  is  also  increasing  the  presence  of famine. And the menace of terrorism remains one of the biggest challenges we face today. This is an ever-present blemish on our common humanity. . Which  is  why,  my  first  and  foremost  duty  this morning would be to call on the world community to give our hope resoluteness by backing them up       with effort. I believe the five rays of hope offered in your PGA manifesto presents great hope in itself. Mr. President, . From  our  small  island  nations  to  the  powers spanning  continents,  the  consequences  of  Covid- have been the same.  . It has laid bare, in the starkest of terms, what we have  all  already  known.  Namely,  that  in  today’s world,  we  are  bound  together.  We  must  work together,  in  solidarity,  in  unity,  to  achieve  our ambitions together.  Mr. President; . For the Maldives, as was the case the world over, the  Covid-  pandemic  was  a  challenge  without precedent.  Our  economy  relies  on  welcoming import  nearly tourists  to  these  shores.  We everything from food to medicine to the materials we build our shelters with.           . Having shut down our borders, we were faced with catastrophic outcomes. Tourists stopped arriving. Foreign  currency  receipts  dropped.  Businesses went under. . The  lockdown  hindered  social  wellbeing.  It  set back years of schooling for our beloved children. . Our task at hand back then was to determine the best  course  of  action.  The  decision  to  close  our borders  was  neither  desired  nor  welcome.  Left without choice, we had to close our borders. We acquired  all  the  resources  required  to  upgrade our healthcare system from scratch. At the time, a  vaccine  was  a  distant  dream.  Throughout  this plight  we  firmly  abided  by  strict  standards.  We by successfully  managed determinedly following the instructions set by our healthcare  professionals.  Employees,  agencies and  volunteers  willingly  lined  up.  Food,  medical supplies  and  other  necessities  were  stocked  up. As a result, we were able to tackle the pandemic. We  have  vaccinated  %  of  all  school  children, and % of all residents in the Maldives. Schools have  resumed.  Businesses  have  restarted.  Our borders have been reopened, opening the doors to our resorts. The Maldives is ready to welcome pandemic the      the world. The Maldives has once again become the sunny side of life. Come visit us.  Mr. President; . Covid- will persist as long as it is not defeated everywhere. The key is vaccines! Vaccinating the world as soon as possible is the way we overcome. Vaccine equity is of paramount importance in this regard.  . Eventually, in time, as the world recovers from the Covid- menace, we must all, collectively resolve to  make  sure  that  such  a  catastrophe  is  not repeated  again.  Our  citizens  are  banking  their hopes on all present here to ensure that we pool our  resources,  efforts,  knowledge,  skills  and discoveries to prevent the next world pandemic. Mr. President; . Managing the virus is one aspect of recovery from Covid-.  Equally is  the  task  of important rebuilding our economy, restoring livelihoods and a return to normal life.            Mr President; . Covid-  is  an  urgent  call  to  action.  There  is overwhelming scientific evidence that the climate emergency  would  be  catastrophic  to  humanity. The  report  by  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on Climate Change published mere weeks ago was a shocking reiteration of what we have known for long. It was shocking because of the starkness of its  pronouncements.  That  we  have  merely brushed off  the  reality  of climate  change  for  far too long. I wish to highlight one important aspect in this report. That the past five years have been the hottest on record since records started in the mid-nineteenth century. The rate of sea-level rise has tripled in comparison to the period, 1901 to 1970.  We  have  already  caused  a  .  degree Celsius  increase  in  warming  of  the  planet.  The recommendations  are  alarming  given their urgency  -  how  global  emissions  need  to  be reduced by % by 2030, and reach net-zero by 2050, to limit warming to . degrees. “Existential threat”,  “cease  to  exist”,  “climate  vulnerable”, identity”, “risk  of  disappearing”,  “loss  of “ecological  refugees”  are  all  phrases  commonly the  plight  of to  describe tossed  around Maldivians, and other island states like us would face if the current trends continue unabated. The    fact remains.  The difference between . degrees and  degrees is the  Maldives.  One for a  death  sentence overarching state  of environmental  ruin  small  island  states  endure now,  will  without  a  doubt  catch  up  with  bigger nations sooner than later. There is no guarantee of survival for any one nation in a world where the Maldives cease to exist.  . I  come  here  today  with  messages  that  resonate closer to the heart, than the cold facts presented by science.  (Show letters) . I carry in my hand, the words of young Maldivian children  who  have  written  to  me  asking  me  to share their pleas for our world’s climate, with this assembly. . These  are  pleas  to  protect  the  vulnerable environment  that  they  call  home.  The  home where they will grow up in. The home where they hope to achieve their dreams. This is the collective calling of generations to come. We must listen.         . Yet  we  remain  hopeful  that  the  day  is  not  lost. Addressing  the  climate  emergency  requires  a break  from  the  lacklustre  business  as  usual practices  that  currently  dominate  the  global climate  change  regime.  It  requires  countries  to adopt  more  stringent  measures  to  halt  their emissions. It needs the world’s wealthy nations to help  smaller  nations  receive  the  support  in  the form  of  capacity  building,  technology  transfers and financial resources to ramp up their defences in the climate fight. It also requires us to give up our  addiction  to  fossil  fuels  and  adopt  cleaner, smarter technologies for our energy use.  . We are determined to not passively wait on the climate front. We aspire to be more than another cautionary tale of what happens when nature and the  destructive  forces  she  can  unleash  are  not respected.  We  have  put  forward  an  ambitious plan to reach net-zero by 2030, which we hope to achieve with international support.  Mr. President; . When  we  speak  of  pressing  global issues, addressing  terrorism  and  violent  extremism       remain on the agenda. We cannot be complacent to  the  growing  threat  posed  by  extremist interpretations  of  religious  texts.  The  Maldives has  always  prided  itself  on  being  a  moderate Muslim  country in  which  a  pluralistic  and Islam  prevailed.  But  we  are  not rationalist immune  from  the  threat  posed  by  radicalized extremists.  On  the  6th  of  May  this  year  we suffered one of the worst terrorist attacks to have ever  occurred  on  our  soil.  The targeted assassination  attempt  on  our  Speaker  of Parliament, former President Mohamed Nasheed. We  will  not  stand  idly  by  while  more  such cowardly  attacks  are  planned  and  while  more young  minds  are  poisoned  by  false  and  violent interpretations of religion.  . We condemn terrorism in all its forms everywhere and reiterate our steadfast commitment to work with  the  international  community  to  address terrorism  in  a  coordinated  and  comprehensive manner.  Mr. President; . Our Government and the people of the Maldives stand  firmly  and  resolutely  with  the  Palestinian      the  unjust  and people.  Despite  decades  of  United  Nations’ efforts,  the  Palestinian  people  have  yet  to  see justice.  We  continue  to  bear  witness  to  the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people being so wantonly violated, in ever-escalating ways, by Israel. Generations of educated youth around the world  are  standing  up  for  the  rights  of  the Palestininan  people.  They  are  standing  up  in inhumane protest  against treatment of the Palestinian people. Despite the many  resolutions  of  both  the  General  Assembly and  the  Security  Council,  the  rights  of  Palestine are minimal or non-existent. As the Head of State of  a  small  country,  I  am  able  to  stand  here  and speak  to  you  all  today  because  my  country  is recognised as a State. What has the world got to fully  recognising  Palestine  as  an lose  by independent  State?  On  behalf  of  the  Maldivian people, I want the privilege extended to millions of my Palestinian brothers and sisters - for them to be fully recognised by the United Nations and their individual liberties protected. I want to see a fully  recognized  Palestinian  State  with  all  the benefits  and  opportunities  that  membership confers. Maldivians will continue to fight for the full  recognition  of  Palestine  as  an  independent State.    Mr. President; . As a neighbour in the wider South Asia region, we are  also  concerned  about  the  long-term  peace and  stability  of  Afghanistan.  We  want  to  ensure the  safety  of  the  people,  the  protection  and realization of the rights of women and girls. And that  steps  are  taken  to  form  an  inclusive  and for  the  people. representative  government Through can Afghanistan these its  commitment  to  building  a demonstrate country.  peaceful,  durable thriving steps and Mr. President; . I  believe  that  the  United  Nations  still  offers  the best  hope  for  humanity.  This  organization  still represents  the  pinnacle  of  what  concerted diplomacy can achieve and continues to embody the  hopes  of  all,  irrespective  of  status,  class  or gender,  who believe in peaceful dialogue to solve global  problems.  From  famine  to  pandemics  to is  the  most terrorism,  the  United  Nations important  global  platform  for  deliberation  and decision-making  to  solve  the  world’s  most important challenges.          . I  thank  the  international  community  for  their support  to  the  Maldives’  candidature  for  the Presidency of the General Assembly. I wish every success for this Assembly’s work.  Thank you.         "
64,2021,NPL,Nepal,"President, Mr. Secretary General,   Excellencies,   Distinguished delegates. I bring warm greetings to this distinguished audience from the people and Government of Nepal, and their best wishes for the success of this Assembly.        I  congratulate  you,  Mr.  President,  on  your  well-deserved election.  It  is  so  significant  to  see  that  a  South  Asian  is chosen to preside over the proceedings of the 76th session of  the  UN  General  Assembly  at  a  time  when  the  world  is ferment in the midst of COVID- and climate crisis.  Please be assured, Mr. President, of Nepal’s full support in the discharge of your important responsibilities.  Let me also commend the outgoing President His Excellency Mr. Volkan Bozkir for successfully leading the 75th session of the Assembly during the trying times.  I would like to place on record our warmest congratulations to  UN  Secretary  General  His  Excellency  Mr.  Antonio Guterres on his reappointment for a second term of office and commend his leadership of our organization. Mr. President I would like to join world leaders in expressing our deepest condolences to the people across the world, who have lost their loved ones due to the COVID- pandemic.  COVID- has silently and cruelly claimed over . million lives. The crisis has brought the  world to a grinding halt, devastated the global economy, pushed an additional 150 million  people  into  extreme  poverty,  and  threatened  to reverse hard-earned development gains.    The covid crisis has exacerbated pre-existing and perennial challenges  such  as  poverty,  hunger,  unemployment, inequalities,  and climate change.  This has exposed systemic weaknesses, vulnerabilities, and inadequacies in health system around the world. Nowhere is this distinctly visible than in the most weak and vulnerable countries where people remain deprived of access to even basic civic amenities.  The  theme  of  the  General  Debate  ‘building  resilience through hope’ is both timely and pertinent.  Recovering from  COVID  ,  rebuilding  sustainably, responding to the needs of the planet, respecting the rights of people, and revitalizing the United Nations aptly mirrors the pressing priorities, challenges, and needs.  Reviving hope is critical in times of crisis. We appreciate the efforts made by the international community including the United Nations system to address the challenges posed by COVID-.  We  also  welcome  the  pledges  of  funds  and  vaccines. Increased commitment and resources are needed for these initiatives.  Deepening  vaccine  inequality  is  leaving  adverse  socio-economic impacts in many low-income countries.    Fair and equitable access to vaccines must be ensured for everyone,  everywhere.  People’s  lives  should  come  first. Vaccines must be declared as public goods for the benefit of people’s lives. In Nepal, saving lives, strengthening the health system, and pursuing  economic  recovery  and  transformation  underpin our  efforts  to  build  a  sustainable  and  resilient  recovery. Despite  constraints  and  challenges  to  access  COVID- vaccines,  we  have  been  able  to  vaccinate  close  to   percent of our population. We remain grateful to our immediate neighbours-India and China for their support in fighting the covid crisis.  We  also  sincerely  thank  friendly  countries,  like  United States,  Britain,  Japan  and  others  for  providing  vaccines, critical  medical  equipment,  and  medicines  in  our  fight against the pandemic. Mr. President, Recent  developments  in  Afghanistan  are  of  common concerns to all of us. People of Afghanistan deserve better. We  call  for  an  unhindered  humanitarian  access  and  full resumption  of  public  services,  including  health  and education for all sections of Afghan society.     We urge all parties involved to ensure peace, security, and stability so that the Afghan people can live in dignity and enjoy their fundamental rights and freedom. We also urge Afghanistan to engage with the international community on the basis of the principles of the UN Charter and norms of international law.   We call on all concerned parties in Myanmar to respect the will of the people, restore the democratic and constitutional process, and uphold the fundamental rights and freedom of the Myanmar’s people.  We  call  for  an  immediate  end  to  the  hardships  and sufferings  of  the  common  people  in  Libya,  Syria,  and Yemen.  In the Middle East, we reiterate our long-standing position and  want  to  see  peace  and  security  with  a  two-state solution  for  Israel  and  Palestine  living  side  by  side  within secure and recognized international borders. Mr. President, For over  years, Nepal has consistently contributed to the UN  peace  operations  to  promote  peace,  security,  and stability in the conflict-ridden parts of the world.      We attach high importance to the safety and security of UN peacekeepers  and  the  need for  adequate  training, resources, and modern technologies. It is in this spirit that we  endorsed  the  Declaration  of  Shared  Commitments  in support of the ‘Action for Peacekeeping’ initiative.  Nepal has endorsed the Kigali Principles on the protection of civilians and supports the UN Secretary General’s system-wide zero-tolerance policy for sexual exploitation and abuse and aims for zero case scenario in peacekeeping.  As  one  of  the  largest  troop  and  police  contributing countries, Nepal believes that such countries deserve more senior level positions both at the headquarters and in the field based on the level of its contributions. Excellencies and distinguished delegates,   Nepal  condemns forms  and manifestations  and  denounces  all  activities  aimed  to  fuel social discord, communal conflicts, and intolerance.  terrorism in  all its There is a need of robust global cooperation to effectively implement  the  UN  Global  Counter-Terrorism  Strategy,  to combat and control financing of terrorism, and to fight the organized trans-border crimes. This underlines the urgency for  conclusion  of  a  comprehensive  convention  against terrorism.     It  is  worrisome  to  see  new  signs  of  arms  race  through modernization of nuclear arms, and weaponization of outer space  among  big  powers.  We  call  upon  them  to  divert precious resources from military spending to addressing the covid- pandemic and lifting the most vulnerable people out of poverty.  The mechanisms of disarmament as well as the measures of  non-proliferation  and  confidence  building  have  been stalled. Nepal calls for general and complete disarmament of  all  weapons  of  mass  destruction  in  a  time-bound  and verifiable manner.  As  the  host  to  the  UN  Regional  Center  for  Peace  and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific, we are committed to supporting  the  works  of  the  Centre  and  reviving  the Kathmandu  Process  for  promoting  regional  efforts  on disarmament, arms control, and non-proliferation. Mr. President, Whether it is the rising of sea levels or melting of Himalayan glaciers, hurricanes, storms, floods or fires, climate change has  become  an  existential  threat  to  humanity.  Reports indicate  that  warmer  conditions  have even  prompted animals  and  plants to  adopt  new  habits  and evolve  new traits.    Nepal  is  home  to  eight  of  the  world's   highest  peaks including  the  top  of  the  world-  Sagarmatha,  the  Mount Everest.  Sagarmatha  stands  as  an  icon  of  adventure seekers  and  Himalayan  heritage the environmental  concerns  are  growing,  we  need  to  raise environmental awareness. While we welcome climbers from around the world, we expect climbers’ cooperation to bring back the garbage from the high mountains to maintain their sanctity.  for  us.  As Nepal has a number of snow-fed Himalayan rivers that are connected to identity and civilizations and sustain one fifth of the global population. Our efforts have been to accord due  ecological  diligence  while  undertaking  development activities in the Himalayan region.  Nepal  is  at  the  sharp  end  of  climate  change  despite  its negligible share in greenhouse gas emissions. On our part, we reiterate our commitment to delivering climate-resilient development pathways by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050.  The principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, equity and respective capabilities should be at the center of the climate agenda to ensure climate justice.      The Glasgow COP26 must provide a breakthrough. Climate ambition of developing countries must be met with easier access to adequate financial and technological support for adaptation and mitigation. It must be a gateway to greener, cleaner, and smarter energy transition. Mr. President, With just less than a decade left, the world is not on track to  achieve  the  2030  Agenda.  The  pandemic  has  strained our efforts to realize the SDGs.   As we strive for resilient recovery and building back better and stronger, achieving SDGs should be at the center of our priorities.  Nepal has mainstreamed the SDGs into its national plans, policies,  and  programmes.  Significant  progress  has  been achieved across major sectors, such as education, health, gender equality and women’s empowerment. Changing  the  lives  of  people  lacking  wealth,  dignity,  and human rights has been our commitment. The  Least  developed  countries  (LDCs)  are  the  most vulnerable  group  of  countries  even  at  the  first  quarter  of the  21st  century.  They  should  be  freed  from  the dehumanizing and  under development.   of  poverty conditions   LDCs  and  LLDCs  need  reliable  and  sustainable  financing, partnerships,  and  technology  transfer  to  overcome  their structural impediments to benefit from globalization. As both an LDC and LLDC, Nepal’s structural challenges are unique. We see our plan to graduate from the LDC category by 2026 as an opportunity to bring structural transformation and  make  the  long-held  national  aspiration  of  graduation smooth, sustainable, and irreversible. We look up to the LDC- to be held in Doha early next year as  an  important  opportunity  to  renew  the  bond  of international  partnership.  It  must  build  on  the  unfinished business of IPOA, with a commitment to enhanced level of support to the graduating countries. The  development  of  multi-modal  transport  infrastructure and  unhindered  transit  rights  of  landlocked  nations  are critical to their sustainable development.  We  call  for  the  implementation  of  past  decisions  and programmes in full synergy and  coherence with  the  2030 Agenda and expect development partners to increase their support to establish a secure, reliable, and efficient transit transport system for the landlocked developing countries.  The ongoing crisis must not be a pretext for retracting from ODA commitments.   The development potentials of South-South cooperation in terms  of  trade,  investment  and  technology  must  be  fully exploited.  is time to  reform  global  economic  governance It architecture to ensure fair and equitable representation of all. We welcome the steps taken by IMF and G20 on debt relief  and  debt  service  suspension.  Nepal  calls  for  a reformed  and  more  equitable international  debt restructuring  to  address  the  debt  crisis  of  low-income countries. is  not  only  about  maintaining WTO rules-based international  trading  order,  it  must  also  be  a  platform  to enable  the  developing  countries  benefit  from  it  with  an enhanced level of international cooperation in the areas of aid for trade, technology transfer, and capacity building.  Connectivity is lifeline for peace, progress, and prosperity. Connectivity  forms  a  premise  for  enduring  cooperation, deeper integration, building of trust and confidence among nations.  Nepal  attaches  utmost  priority  to  cooperation through  connectivity  and  underlines  the  need  to  create  a win-win situation between and among countries.      Excellencies and Distinguished Delegates,  Nepal  calls  for  concerted  efforts  to  ensure  the  safety, security, dignity, and well-being of all migrant workers.  We call for the effective implementation of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration and underline the need  for  a  more  robust  international  governance  for  the protection, safety, and welfare of the migrant workers. Protection  of  minorities  and  their  rights  makes  the  world more humane and contributes to world peace and security. Despite not being a party to the Refugee Convention and its  Protocol,  Nepal  has  hosted  thousands  of  refugees  on humanitarian principles.  Nepal  considers  the  forced  eviction  of  citizens  as  a  grave crime  against  humanity.  We  call  upon  the  international community  to  respond  responsibly  and  act  decisively  for refugees’  right  to  return  to  their  homeland  in  safety  and dignity. Mr. President, Nepal  has  chosen  the  democratic  path  to  development. Democracy  is  about  people  and  therefore  democracy  is indispensable for people’s welfare.    The The constitution of Nepal accommodates aspirations of all its citizens. Proportional representation of all sections of the society is at its core. It guarantees a comprehensive set of internationally  recognized  human  rights  and  fundamental powerful freedoms. commissions  to  promote  and  protect  rights  and  interests specific  to  women,  Dalits,  Muslims,  Madhesis,  indigenous people and other disadvantaged communities. It makes it mandatory to have % women representation in federal and provincial parliaments and % at the local level. This has firmed up their role in politics and development.  constitution establishes We  are  committed  to  conclude  the  transitional  justice process through the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the  Commission  of  Investigation  on  Enforced Disappeared Persons. There would be no blanket amnesty in the cases of serious violation of human rights.  As  a  member  elected  for  the  second  term  in  UN  Human Rights Council, we continue to add value through apolitical and impartial approach to human rights. Mr. President,  Nepal’s  worldview  is  shaped  by  our  adherence  to  the principle of ‘amity with all and enmity with none’.     Our friendship with both of our neighbors, India and China, remains  of  paramount  importance  in  the  conduct  of  our foreign policy based on the principles of Panchsheel – five principles  of  peaceful  co-existence,  derived  from  the teachings of Lord Buddha, the enlightened son of Nepal.  The  relevance  of  these  principles  as  a  framework  for interstate  relations  cannot  be  overstated  in  the  present context.  Principles and purposes of the UN Charter, non-alignment, international law and norms of world peace form the basis of our foreign policy.  The  present  government  of  Nepal  led  by  Prime  Minister Sher  Bahadur Deuba  is committed  to conduct the  foreign policy  on  the  basis  of  sovereign  equality,  mutual  respect, and mutual benefit and remains engaged with all friendly countries in the wider international community.  the firmly  believes Nepal indispensability  of in multilateralism  with  the  United  Nations  as  its  centre.  We consider this the only way to build global understanding and cooperation,  promote  shared  interests,  and  secure  our common future.  We add our voices in support of the measures and initiatives aimed at UN reforms. Under-representation of developing countries must be addressed in recognition of their growing contributions.   We  want  to  see  a  more  representative,  inclusive,  and transparent Security Council and a more revitalized General Assembly.  Reforms  must  be  inclusive  and  representative, accountable, and effective in its delivery.   We consider regional cooperation arrangements important for building trust and confidence among nations, managing harmonious  relations  and  making  the  best  use  of complementarities  for  shared  prosperity.  Nepal’s  active engagement  in  SAARC,  BIMSTEC  and  ACD  manifests  our ardent  faith  in  regional  cooperation,  connectivity,  and integration. Over the last sixty-five years, Nepal and the United Nations have  enjoyed  a  strong  partnership-  driven  by  trust, cooperation,  and  mutual  respect.  We  thank  the  United Nations  for  its  continued  support  in  our  development endeavors.  Nepal commends the Secretary-General for bringing out a comprehensive report ‘Our Common Agenda’. We support the  report’s  focus  on  the  agenda  of  action  designed  to accelerate the implementation of existing commitments.  Mr. President,  We live in troubled times. There has been dramatic shift in geopolitics  and  geo-economics  in  the  post-Cold  War  era posing unprecedented challenges on all fronts.    The world’s economic center of gravity is shifting decisively towards  Asia,  centered  on  the  economic  growth  of  China and India.  At the same time, the world is becoming more complicated and  polarized, with  transnational  challenges  ranging  from terrorism  to  climate  change  to  food  security  to  mass migration to political radicalism and extremism.  Under  the  cumulative  impact  of  all  these  factors,  we  are experiencing with new ways of life in the midst of confusion and uncertainty.  We  see  conflicts  in  different  parts  of  the  world,  these conflicts  are  more  within  nations  than  between  nations. This  has  given  rise  to  identity  politics.    Nations  find themselves  increasingly  divided  along  lines  of  race, ethnicity, gender and religion.  We must find a common ground and practice tolerance and harmony  to  confront  these  unimaginable  problems.  My delegation  considers  that  democracy  and  multilateralism have no alternative to overcome the stresses and strains of the day. It is also the best antidote to the risk of civil conflict in ethnically diverse societies.      I  feel  happy  to  share  with  this  august  audience  that  the unity in vast diversity is Nepal’s national strength. Thanks to  the  democratic  culture  and  harmonious  way  of  life, Nepali  people’s  resilience  in  times  of  hardships  and sufferings has remained exemplary as seen in the aftermath of the devastating earthquakes of 2015, and the COVID- pandemic in recent times.  As I stand here today, my thoughts go back to 1960, when the first elected Prime Minister of Nepal, late B.P. Koirala, while  addressing  the  UN  General  Assembly,  said,  and  I quote,  “As we look at the  world,  we find  that  it is  the  economic disparity  between  countries,  as  between  the  rich  and  the poor people within the nation, that is the source of much friction  and  tension.  …….The  main  function  of  the  United Nations at the present moment is the creation or recreation of a climate of confidence and trust.”  End of quote.  Creating  a  climate  of  confidence  and  trust  is  as  relevant today as it was in 1960.  It is upon us to work together for a more equitable, just, fair, resilient, and sustainable world.  In  conclusion,  I  believe  the  time  is  now  to  turn  the  crisis into opportunity, despair into hope, and risk into resilience.     The  time  is  now  to  build  a  stronger,  interconnected,  and inclusive  multilateral  system  grounded  in  cooperation, solidarity and mutual trust.  We must rise to our responsibility to re-build for the sake of the people we serve and the planet we live in.   I thank you for your attention.   "
65,2021,PAK,Pakistan,"President, I congratulate you on assuming the presidency of the 76th session of the General Assembly.  I  also  wish  to  express  appreciation  for  the  significant  achievements  of  your predecessor,  Volkan  Bozkir,  who  guided  the  Assembly  skilfully  under  the difficult circumstances imposed by the Covid- pandemic. Mr. President, The  world  is  facing  triple  challenge  of  the  Covid-,  the  accompanying economic crisis, and the threats posed by climate change.  The  virus  does  not  discriminate  between  nations  and  people.  Nor  do  the catastrophes imposed by uncertain weather patterns.  The  common  threats  faced  by  us  today  not  only  expose  the  fragility  of  the international system; they also underscore the oneness of humanity.  By  the  grace  of  Almighty  Allah,  Pakistan  has  been  successful  so  far  in containing  the  Covid  pandemic.  Our  calibrated  strategy  of  ‘smart  lockdowns’ helped save lives and livelihoods and kept the economy afloat. Over  million families survived through our social protection programme of Ehsaas.  Mr. President,               Climate  change  is  one  of  the  primary  existential  threats  that  our  planet  faces today. Pakistan’s contribution to global emissions is negligible. Yet we are among the  most vulnerable countries to the effects of climate change in the world.  Being fully aware of our global responsibilities, we have embarked upon game-changing  environmental  programmes:  reforesting  Pakistan  through  our   billion tree tsunami; preserving natural habitats; switching to renewable energy; removing  pollution  from  our  cities;  and  adapting  to  the  impacts  of  climate change. To address the triple crisis of covid pandemic, economic downturn, and climate emergency, we need a comprehensive strategy that should include: One,  vaccine  equity:  everyone,  everywhere,  must  be  vaccinated  against Covid, and as soon as possible; Two, adequate financing must be made available to developing countries. This can be ensured through comprehensive debt restructuring; expanded ODA;  redistribution  of  unutilized  SDRs,  and  allotment  of  a  greater proportion  of  SDRs  to  developing  countries;  and  finally,  provision  of climate finance; and Three,  we  must  adopt  clear  investment  strategies  which  help  alleviate poverty,  promote  job  creation,  build  sustainable  infrastructure,  and  of course bridge the digital divide.  I propose that the Secretary-General convene an SDG summit in 2025 to review and accelerate implementation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  Mr. President, Because of the plunder of the developing world by their corrupt ruling elites, the gap between the rich and the poor countries is increasing at an alarming speed.              Through  this  platform,  I  have  been  drawing  the  world’s  attention  towards  the scourge of illicit financial flows from developing countries.  The  Secretary  General’s  High-Level  Panel  on  Financial  Accountability, Transparency  and  Integrity  (FACTI)  has  calculated  that  a  staggering   trillion dollars in stolen assets are parked in the financial “haven” destinations.  This organized theft and illegal transfer of assets has profound consequences for the developing nations.  It depletes their already meagre resources, accentuates the  levels  of  poverty  especially  when  laundered  money  puts  pressure  on  the currency and leads to its devaluation. At the current rate, when the FACTI Panel estimates that a trillion dollar every year is taken out of the developing world, there will be mass exodus of economic migrants towards the richer nations.  What the East India Company did to India, the crooked ruling elites are doing to developing  world  -  plundering  the  wealth  and  transferring  to  western  capitals and offshore tax havens.  And Mr. President, retrieving the stolen assets from the developed countries is impossible  for  poor  nations.  The  rich  countries  have  no  incentives,  or compulsion, to return this ill-gotten wealth, and this ill-gotten wealth belongs to the  masses  of  the  developing  world.  I  foresee,  in  the  not-too-distant  future  a time will come when the rich countries will be forced to build walls to keep out economic migrants from these poor countries.   I fear a few “wealthy islands” in the sea of poverty will also turn into a global calamity, like climate change. The  General  Assembly  must  take  steps  meaningfully  to  address  this  deeply disturbing, and morally repugnant, situation.  Naming and shaming the  ‘haven’ destinations  and  developing  a  comprehensive  legal  framework  to  halt  and reverse  the  illicit  financial  flows  are  most  critical  actions  to  stop  this  grave economic injustice. And at a minimum, the recommendations of  Secretary General's  FACTI panel should be fully implemented.            Mr. President, Islamophobia is another pernicious phenomenon that we all need to collectively combat. In  the  aftermath  of  /  terrorist  attacks,  terrorism  has  been  associated  with Islam  by  some  quarters.  This  has  increased  the  tendency  of  right-wing, xenophobic  and  violent  nationalists,  extremists  and  terrorist  groups  to  target Muslims.  The  UN  Global  Counter  Terrorism  Strategy  has  recognized  these  emerging threats. We hope the Secretary-General’s report will focus on these new threats of terrorism posed by Islamophobes and right-wing extremists.  I call on the Secretary-General to convene a global dialogue on countering the rise  of  Islamophobia.  Our  parallel  efforts,  at  the  same  time,  should  be  to promote interfaith harmony, and they should continue.  Mr. President, The worst and most pervasive form of Islamophobia now rules India. The hate-filled  ‘Hindutva’  ideology,  propagated  by  the  fascist  RSS-BJP  regime,  has unleashed  a  reign  of  fear  and  violence  against  India’s  200  million  strong Muslim  community. Mob  lynching by cow vigilantes; frequent pogroms, such as the one in New Delhi last year; discriminatory citizenship laws to purge India of Muslims; and a campaign to destroy mosques across  India and obliterate its Muslim heritage and history, are all part of this criminal enterprise. New Delhi has also embarked on what it ominously calls the “final solution” for the Jammu and Kashmir dispute. It has undertaken:  -  a  series  of  illegal  and  unilateral  measures  in  Occupied  Jammu  and Kashmir since 5th August 2019;  it has unleashed a reign of terror by an occupation force of 900,000;  it has jailed senior Kashmiri leadership;  imposed a clampdown on media and internet;  - - - -  violently suppressed peaceful protests;             -  abducted ,000 young Kashmiris and tortured hundreds of them;  - it  has  extra-judicially  killed  hundreds  of  innocent  Kashmiris  in  fake “encounters”; and  imposed collective punishments by destroying entire neighbourhoods and villages.  - We  have  unveiled  a  detailed  dossier  on  gross  and  systematic  violations  of human rights by the  Indian Security Forces in Occupied Jammu and Kashmir.This  repression  is  accompanied  by  illegal  efforts  to  change  the  demographic structure of the occupied territory, and transform it from a Muslim majority into a Muslim minority.  Indian actions violate the resolutions of the UN Security Council on Jammu and Kashmir.  The  resolutions  clearly  prescribe  that  the  “final  disposition”  of  the disputed territory should be decided by its people, through a free and impartial plebiscite held under the UN auspices.  India’s  actions  in  Occupied  Jammu  and  Kashmir  also  violate  International Human  Rights  and  Humanitarian  Laws,  including  the  4th  Geneva  Convention, and amount to “war crimes” and “crimes against humanity.”  It  is  unfortunate,  very  unfortunate,  that  the  world’s  approach  to  violations  of human  rights  lacks  even-handedness,  and  even  is  selective.  Geopolitical considerations, or corporate interests, commercial interests often compel major powers to overlook the transgressions of their “affiliated” countries.  Such double standards are the most glaring in case of India, where this RSS-BJP regime  is  being  allowed  to  get  away  with  human  rights  abuses  with  complete impunity.  The most recent example of Indian barbarity was the forcible snatching of the mortal remains of the  great  Kashmiri leader,  Syed Ali Shah Geelani, from his family, denying him a proper Islamic funeral and burial, in accordance with his wishes and Muslim traditions.              Devoid  of  any  legal  or  moral  sanction,  this  action  was  even  against  the  basic norms of human decency. I call on this General Assembly to demand that Syed Geelani’s mortal remains be allowed to be buried in the “cemetery of martyrs” with the appropriate Islamic rites. Mr. President, Pakistan  desires  peace  with  India,  as  with  all  its  neighbours.  But  sustainable peace  in  South Asia  is contingent upon  resolution of the  Jammu  and  Kashmir dispute,  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  United  Nations  Security  Council resolutions, and the wishes of the Kashmiri people.  Last  February, we reaffirmed the 2003 ceasefire understanding along the  Line of Control. The hope was that it would lead to a rethink of the strategy in New Delhi.  Sadly,  the  BJP  government  has  intensified  repression  in  Kashmir  and continues to vitiate the environment by these barbaric acts.  The  onus  remains  on  India  to  create  a  conducive  environment  for  meaningful and result-oriented engagement with Pakistan. And for that, it must do: One,  reverse  its  unilateral  and  illegal  measures  instituted  since  5th August 2019; Two,  stop  its  oppression  and  human  rights  violations  against  the people of Kashmir; and Three,  halt  and  reverse  the  demographic  changes  in  the  occupied territory. It  is  also  essential  to  prevent  another  conflict  between  Pakistan  and  India. India’s  military  build-up,  development  of  advanced  nuclear  weapons,  and acquisition  of  destabilising  conventional  capabilities,  can  erode  mutual deterrence between the two countries. And  now  Mr.  President,  I  want  to  talk  about  Afghanistan.  For  the  current situation in Afghanistan, for some reason, Pakistan has been blamed for the turn of events, by politicians in the United States and some politicians in Europe.            From this platform, I want them all to know, the country that suffered the most, apart  from  Afghanistan,  was  Pakistan,  when  we joined the  US  War  on  Terror after /.  ,000  Pakistanis  died.  $150  billion  dollars  were  lost  to  our  economy.  There were .  million internally displaced  Pakistanis.  And  why  did this happen?  In the 1980s, Pakistan was a front-line state in  fighting against the occupation of Afghanistan. Pakistan and the United States trained Mujahideen groups to fight for  the  liberation  of  Afghanistan.  Amongst  those  Mujahideen  groups  was  Al-Qaeda, various groups from all over the world. There were Mujahideen, Afghan Mujahideen. These were considered heroes.  President  Ronald  Regan  invited  them  to  the  White  House  in  1983.  And according  to  a  news  item,  he  compared  them  to  the  founding  fathers  of  the United States. They were heroes.  Come  1989,  the  Soviets  leave,  and  so  do  the  Americans  -  abandoning Afghanistan.  Pakistan  was  left  with    million  Afghan  refugees.  We  were  left with sectarian militant groups which were never existed before. But the worse cut of it was, that a year later Pakistan was sanctioned by the US. We felt used.  Fast forward /, Pakistan is needed again by the US, because now the US-led coalition  was  invading  Afghanistan,  and  it  could  not  happen  without  Pakistan providing all the logistical support.  What happened after that?  The same Mujahideen that we had trained, that fighting foreign occupation was a sacred duty, a holy war or jehad, turned against us.  We were called collaborators.  They declared jehad on us. Then all along the tribal belt bordering Afghanistan - Pakistan’s semi-autonomous tribal belt - where no Pakistan army had been there since our independence, people had strong sympathies with the Afghan Taliban, not  because  of  their  religious  ideology  but  because  of  Pashtun  nationalism, which  is  very  strong.  Then  there  are  three  million  Afghan  refugees  still  in           Pakistan  all  Pashtoons,  living  in  the  camps.  500,000  in  the  biggest  camp, 100,000 camps. They all had affinity and sympathy with the Afghan Taliban.  So, what happened? They too turned against Pakistan. For the first time we had militant Taliban in Pakistan. And they too attacked the Government of Pakistan. When our Army went into the tribal areas first time in our history - whenever an army  goes  into  the  civilian  areas,  there  is  collateral  damage  -  so,  there  was collateral damage, which multiplied the militants to seek revenge.  But not just that.  The  world  must  know  that  in  Pakistan  there  were  480  drone  attacks conducted  by  the  US.  And  we  all  know  that  the  drone  attacks  are  not  that precise. They cause more collateral damage than the militants they are targeting.  So,  people  whose  relatives  had  been  killed  sought  revenge  against  Pakistan. Between  2004  and  2014, there  were   different  militant groups attacking the State of Pakistan. At  one  point,  people,  people  like  us  were  worried,  that  will  we  survive  this? There were bombs going all over Pakistan. Our capital was like a fortress.  Had it not been for one of the most disciplined army in the world and one of the best intelligence agencies in the world, I think Pakistan would have gone down.  So, when we hear this at the end. There is a lot of worry in the US about taking care of the interpreters and everyone who helped the US.  What about us?  The only reason we suffered so much was because we became an ally of the US -  of  the  Coalition  -  in  the  war  in  Afghanistan.  There  were  attacks  being conducted from the Afghan soil into Pakistan. At least there should have been a word of appreciation. But rather than appreciation, imagine how we feel when we are blamed for the turn of events in Afghanistan.  After  2006,  it  became  clear  to  everyone  who  understood  Afghanistan  and  its history  that  there  would  be  no  military  solution  in  Afghanistan.  I  went  to  the US,  I  spoke  to  thinktanks,  I  met  the  then  Senator  Biden,  Senator  John  Kerry, Senator  Harry  Reid  –  I  tried  to  explain  to  them  that  there  would  not  be  any           military  solution,  and  political  settlement  was  the  way  forward.  No  one understood then.  And unfortunately, in trying to force a military solution is where the US went wrong.  And  if  today,  the  world  needs  to  know  why  the  Taliban  are  back  in power,  all  it  has  to  do  is  to  do  a  deep  analysis  of  why  a  300,000  strong  well equipped Afghan army – and remember Afghans are one of the bravest nations on earth - gave up without a fight.  The  moment  a  deep  analysis  of  this  is  done,  the  world  would  know  why  the Taliban came back to power and it is not because of Pakistan. Mr. President, Now  the  whole  international  community  should  think  what  is  the  way  ahead. There  are  two  paths  that  we  can  take.  If  we  neglect  Afghanistan  right  now, according to the UN half the people of Afghanistan are already vulnerable, and by next year almost % of the people in Afghanistan will go below the poverty line.  There  is  a  huge  humanitarian  crisis  looming  ahead.  And  this  will  have the  neighbours  of  Afghanistan  but serious  repercussions  not everywhere. A destabilized, chaotic Afghanistan will again become a safe haven for international terrorists - the reason why the US came to Afghanistan in the first place.  just  for Therefore,  there  is  only  one  way  to  go.  We  must  strengthen  and  stabilize  the current government, for the sake of the people of Afghanistan.  What have the Taliban promised?  They will respect human rights.  They will have an inclusive government.  They will not allow their soil to be used by terrorist. And they have given amnesty. If  the  world  community  incentivises  them,  and  encourages  them  to  walk  this talk,  it  will  be  a  win-win  situation  for  everyone.  Because  these  are  the  four conditions that the US-Taliban dialogue in Doha was all about.            If  the  world  can  incentivise  them  to  go  this  direction,  then  this  twenty-year presence  of  the  coalition  forces  in  Afghanistan  would  not  be  wasted  after  all. Because the Afghan soil would not be used by the international terrorists.  I  end  Mr.  President,  by  urging  everyone  that  this  is  a  critical  time  for Afghanistan. You cannot waste time. Help is needed there. Humanitarian assistance has to be given there immediately. The Secretary General of the United Nations has taken bold steps. I urge you to mobilize the international community, and move in this direction.  Thank you.      "
66,2021,LKA,Sri Lanka,"President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka at the General Debate of the Seventy-Sixth Session of the  United Nations General Assembly  September 2021 Mr. President, Secretary General, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, Ayubowan, I am honoured to represent Sri Lanka at this august gathering today.  Let me first congratulate His Excellency Abdulla Shahid on being elected President of the 76th session of the General Assembly.   Mr. President, you have long been a friend of Sri Lanka. We look forward to working closely with you in the year ahead.  I also take this opportunity to convey our appreciation of His Excellency Volkan Bozkir’s stewardship of the previous session of the General Assembly, and to commend Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his leadership in these difficult times. Mr. President, The COVID19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on humanity.  I sympathise deeply with all who have lost their loved ones during the pandemic. I  thank  frontline  healthcare  and  essential  workers  around  the  world  for their  dedication  and  commend the World Health Organisation for its crisis response.  I also greatly appreciate the rapid advances made by the scientific and medical communities in devising vaccines and treatment protocols to combat the virus. At  the  same  time,  we  must  recognise  that  the  challenges  surrounding  production,  distribution, deployment and acceptance of vaccines must be overcome urgently if the spread of dangerous new virus strains is to be prevented.   Ensuring that everyone, everywhere, is vaccinated is the best way out of the pandemic.                          Although still a developing nation, Sri Lanka has been very successful in its vaccination programme. We have already fully vaccinated nearly all those above the age of .  Everyone over the age of  will be fully vaccinated by the end of October. We will start vaccinating children over  years of age in the near future.  The  rapid  progress  of  vaccinations  was  enabled  by  coordinated  efforts  between  healthcare  workers, Armed Forces and Police personnel, Government servants, and elected officials.  In collaboration with the WHO, Sri Lanka is establishing a Regional Knowledge Hub to facilitate exchange of lessons learnt from COVID19 and support countries to recover better.  Sri Lanka also benefitted greatly from financial and material support provided by bilateral and multilateral donors to manage the pandemic. I thank these nations and institutions for their generosity. The increased global cooperation  visible  during  this  ongoing  crisis  is greatly  encouraging.  However,  there  is  still  more  to  be done. Mr. President, The economic impact of the pandemic has been especially severe on developing countries.  This  has  placed  the  implementation  of  the  2030  Agenda  for  Sustainable  Development  Goals  at considerable risk. It  is  vital  that  more  initiatives  including  development  financing  and  debt  relief  be  adopted  through international  mechanisms  to  support  developing  nations  and  help  them  emerge  from  this  uncertain situation.  Sri Lanka too has suffered greatly due to the pandemic. In addition to the tragic loss of life, our economy has been deeply affected.  The  lockdowns,  together  with  general  movement  restrictions,  reduced  international  travel,  and  slower global growth have affected nearly all sectors of our economy.  Tourism, one of Sri Lanka’s highest foreign exchange earners and a sector that supports nearly % of the population, has been devastated. This industry, together with small and medium businesses in many other sectors, received Government support through interest moratoriums and other financial sector interventions. Daily wage earners and low-income groups were also supported through grants of cash and dry rations during lockdowns, adding significantly to state expenditure.  In addition to their immediate impact, these economic repercussions of the pandemic have limited the fiscal space available to implement our development programmes.  Mr. President,  As devastating as the consequences of the pandemic have been to humanity, the world faces the even greater challenge of climate change in the decades to come.                     As  emphasised  in  the  recent  report  by  the  Inter-governmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change,  the unprecedented effect of human activity on the health of the planet is deeply worrying. Addressing the grave threats posed by climate change and the loss of biodiversity requires decisive and urgent multilateral action.  As a climate-vulnerable country, Sri Lanka is deeply aware of the dangers of climate change. Sri Lanka’s philosophical heritage, deeply rooted in Lord Buddha’s teachings, also emphasises the vitality of preserving environmental integrity.  It  is  in these  contexts  that  Sri  Lanka  is  a  Commonwealth  Blue  Charter  Champion  and  leads  the  Action Group on Mangrove Restoration.  Through the adoption of the Colombo Declaration on Sustainable Nitrogen Management, which seeks to halve nitrogen waste by 2030, Sri Lanka has also contributed to global efforts to reduce environmental pollution.  Having participated virtually in the Pre-Summit held in April, I trust that the United Nations Food Summit later this month will result in actionable outcomes to promote healthier, more sustainable, and equitable food systems globally. Such outcomes will be crucial to human health as well as to the health of our planet.  Sustainability  is  a  cornerstone  of  Sri  Lanka’s  national  policy  framework.  Because  of  its  impact  on  soil fertility,  biodiversity,  waterways  and  health,  my  Government  banned  the  use  of  chemical  fertilisers, pesticides,  and  weedicides  earlier  this  year.  Production  and  adoption  of  organic  fertiliser,  as  well  as investments into organic agriculture, are being incentivised. I  appreciate  the  encouragement  received  from  many  global  institutions  and  nations  for  our  efforts  to create a more sustainable agriculture in Sri Lanka.  The conservation of our environment is one of our key national priorities.  We aim to increase forest cover significantly in the coming decades. We are also working to clean and restore over 100 rivers countrywide, and to combat river and maritime pollution. We have also banned single use plastics to support ecological conservation.  Sri  Lanka  recognises  the  urgent  need  to  reduce  use  of  fossil  fuels  and  support  decarbonisation.    Our energy  policy  seeks  to  increase  the  contribution  of  renewable  sources  such  as  solar,  wind  and hydropower to % of our national energy needs by 2030. Mr. President, Sri Lanka welcomes the support of the international community as it engages in the task of reviving its economy  and  carrying  out  its  national  development  programme.  We  intend  to  make  full  use  of geostrategic  location  and  our  robust  institutions,  strong  social  infrastructure,  and  skilled  workforce,  to attract investment and broaden trade relationships.  My  Government  is  focusing  on  extensive  legal,  regulatory,  administrative  and  educational  reforms  to facilitate this, and to deliver prosperity to all our people.   Sri Lanka has enjoyed universal adult franchise since pre-Independence.                   The democratic tradition is an integral part of our way of life.  My  election  in  2019  and  the  Parliamentary  election  in  2020  saw  Sri  Lankan  voters  grant  an  emphatic mandate to my Government to build a prosperous and stable country, and uphold national security and sovereignty. In  2019,  Sri  Lanka  experienced  the  devastation  wrought  by  extremist  religious  terrorists  in  the  Easter Sunday  attacks.  Before  that,  until  2009,  it  had  suffered  from  a  separatist  terrorist  war  for    years. Terrorism  is  a  global  challenge  that  requires  international  cooperation,  especially  on  matters  such  as intelligence sharing, if it is to be overcome. Violence robbed Sri Lanka of thousands of lives and decades of prosperity in the past half century. My Government is committed to ensuring that such violence never takes place in Sri Lanka again.  We are therefore acting to address the core issues behind it.  Fostering  greater  accountability,  restorative  justice,  and  meaningful  reconciliation  through  domestic institutions is essential to achieve lasting peace. So too is ensuring more equitable participation in the fruits of economic development. It is my Government’s firm intention to build a prosperous, stable and secure future for all Sri Lankans, regardless of ethnicity, religion, or gender. We are ready to engage with all domestic stakeholders, and to obtain the support  of our international partners and the United Nations, in this process. However, history has shown that  lasting results can only be achieved through home-grown institutions reflecting the aspirations of the people. Sri Lanka’s Parliament, Judiciary and its range of independent statutory bodies should have unrestricted scope to exercise their functions and responsibilities.  Mr. President, Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates, If, in keeping with the theme of our General Debate today, we are to truly build resilience through hope, we must all strive towards the common good.  It is the role of the United Nations to facilitate this by treating all sovereign states, irrespective of size or strength, equitably, and with due respect for their institutions and their heritage.  I request the United Nations and the international community to ensure the protection of the Buddhist heritage of Afghanistan.  I  call  on  the  member  states  of  this  august  Assembly  to  work  together  in  a  spirit  of  true  cooperation, generosity, goodwill, and mutual respect to foster a better and more sustainable future for all humanity.  Thank you.                     "
67,2021,ARM,Armenia,"President of the General Assembly, Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to once again deliver a statement at the United Nations General Assembly. First of all, I would like to congratulate Mr. Abdulla Shahid on his election as President of the General Assembly, as well as Mr. Antnio Guterres on his re-election as Secretary-General of the  United  Nations.  I  am  confident  that  with  your  leadership  you  will  help  us  overcome  the vast challenges we are facing.  Today in my speech, I would like to refer to the situation in the South Caucasus region, present our views and proposals on the solution of the existing problems. As you know, in the fall of 2020, Nagorno-Karabakh was subjected to aggression. The war that lasted  forty-four  days  took  the  lives  of  several  thousands  of  people.  Tens  of  thousands  of residents of Nagorno-Karabakh were displaced. The aggression was accompanied by numerous gross  violations  of  international  law  by  the  Azerbaijani  armed  forces,  including  deliberate targeting  of  civilians  and  vital  infrastructure,  extrajudicial  killings  of  prisoners  of  war  and civilian hostages, torture and many other documented crimes. As a result of these actions, in the  parts  of  Nagorno-Karabakh,  which  came  under  the  control  of  Azerbaijan,  the  Armenian people  were  subjected  to  complete  ethnic  cleansing.  Unfortunately,  the  international community  here  again  could  not  prevent  the  mass  atrocities.  Today,  no  Armenian  lives  or practically could live in the territories under the control of Azerbaijan. Thanks  to  the  mediation  efforts  of  the  Russian  Federation,  it  was  possible  to  stop  the bloodshed. On November , a trilateral ceasefire statement was signed. Peacekeeping forces of the Russian Federation were deployed in Nagorno-Karabakh, which today ensure stability and security thereon. Dear Colleagues, One  month  ago,  the  Republic  of  Armenia  National  Assembly  approved  the  Government's Action  Plan  for  2021-2026,  where  one  of  the  key  provisions  is  to  open  an  era  of  peaceful development  for  our  country  and  the  region.  Moreover,  as  per  the  results  of  the  early parliamentary election held on June , 2021, the people of Armenia gave to our Government a  mandate  to  move  towards  this  key  goal.  It  should  be  emphasized  that  our  Government received this important mandate based on the results of elections that were held to overcome the domestic political crisis. This was the second election in our country after the Non-violent, Velvet, People's Revolution in Armenia in  2018.  Both elections were assessed by international  observers as competitive, transparent, and in line with democratic standards.     So, how are we going to achieve the goal of opening an era of peaceful development for our country  and  the  region?  Through  dialogue,  overcoming  incrementally  the  atmosphere  of painful hostility in our region. We realize that the path will be difficult and long. Unfortunately, the  incidents  designed  to  delegitimize  the  peace  agenda  and  deepen  and  institutionalize  the atmosphere  of  hostility  occur  on  a  daily  basis.  Violations  of  the  ceasefire,  aggressive  and insulting  statements  against  Armenia  and  the  Armenian  people  continue  to  escalate  the atmosphere. An  act  against  the  peace  agenda  is  the  fact  that,  contrary  to  Article    of  the  November   statement, Azerbaijan not only still holds several dozen citizens of the Republic of Armenia in captivity, but also has sentenced many of them to  to  years imprisonment on trumped-up charges.  In  addition,  there  are  persons  whose  captivity  has  not  yet  been  confirmed  by Azerbaijan, although there is clear evidence that they were captured. This becomes even more unacceptable against the background that in the fall of 2020, Azerbaijani users posted videos of the  capture  of  specific  Armenian  soldiers,  and  later  the  decapitated  or  shot  bodies  of  those soldiers were discovered. We have irrefutable evidence about the torture of our captives.  An outrageous example of the deepening of the atmosphere of hostility is the opening  of the so-called  trophy  park  in  Baku,  where  Azerbaijani  schoolchildren  are  taken  on  excursions  to watch the mannequins of captured, killed or bleeding Armenian soldiers. These and other steps are taken to demonstrate the impossibility of peace in our region, but we  will  consistently  advance  that  agenda  by  using  every  opportunity  and  by  creating  new opportunities to open an era of peace for our region.  In this sense, I consider the opening of regional communications extremely important, which is stated  in  the  9th  point  of  the  trilateral  declaration  signed  by  the  President  of  the  Russian Federation,  the  President  of  Azerbaijan  and  the  Prime  Minister  of  Armenia  of  November  , 2020 and January , 2021. The interconnected transport arteries of the region will be an outcome of resolving this issue. Opportunity  will  be  created  for  establishing  economic  ties,  which  is  one  of  the  important prerequisites for peaceful development.  While examining the topic of reopening transport links, we discovered that there are options that aim at sustaining regional isolation and hostility, but there are also options that emphasize regional interconnectedness and can be a step-by-step solution of the problem of hostility. We are an advocate for the latter option.   If the railway connecting Armenia to Turkey is opened too, then the topic of opening regional communications will cover broader scope.  Honorable Mr. Secretary General, Armenia  is  ready  for  a  constructive  dialogue,  which  should  lead  to  the  establishment  of sustainable and lasting peace in the region. In this regard, we propose to complete the process of return of prisoners of war, hostages and other captives without delay.  It is also necessary to resume the peace process for the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict under the auspices of the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs.   There  is  no  doubt  that  the situation  created  through  the  use  of  force  cannot  gain  legitimacy from  the  point  of  view  of  international  law.  The  right  of  the  people  of  Artsakh  to  self-determination  cannot  be  suspended  through  the  use  of  force;  the  conflict  cannot  be considered resolved through the use of force. The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is awaiting its just settlement.  This  is  evidenced  by  the  statements  of  the  Co-Chair  countries,  which  emphasize the need to resume the negotiation process based on the well-known principles. We believe that the contacts mediated by the Co-Chairs will enable the parties to find common ground, and to open avenues for addressing many difficult issues. Next  is  the  issue  of  delimitation  and  demarcation  of  the  Armenia-Azerbaijan  border.  I  must state with regret that it is difficult to imagine a border delimitation process on the backdrop of almost  daily  shootings  and  various  provocations  on  the  Armenian-Azerbaijani  border,  on  the backdrop of units of the armed forces of Azerbaijan having infiltrated the sovereign territory of the  Republic  of  Armenia  on  May  ,  2021  in  the  Sotk-Khoznavar  section.  To  overcome  this situation, we have suggested the following actions: In the above mentioned section, the armed forces  of  both  Armenia  and  Azerbaijan  should  withdraw  simultaneously  to  the  Soviet  times border, international observers would be deployed along that border and under international auspices  we  would  start  delimitation  and  demarcation.  We  are  ready  to  implement  this proposal at any time. Dear Colleagues, In  my  speech,  I  touched  upon  issues  of  vital  importance  for  our  country  and  for  the  region. These  issues  need  urgently  to  be  addressed  today  and  require  the  urgent  attention  of  the international community. At  the  same  time,  as  I  conclude  my  speech,  I  would  like  to  reaffirm  that  Armenia,  as  a responsible  member  of  the  international  community  and  a  reliable  partner,  will  continue  to contribute  to  the  strengthening  of  comprehensive  international  order,  to  international cooperation  based  on  the  purposes  and  principles  of  the  UN  Charter,  promoting  sustainable development and protection of fundamental human rights. We are committed to a constructive and inclusive dialogue with all our partners. Armenia  is  ready  to  make  every  effort  to  contribute  to  overcoming  the  current  global challenges  such  as  climate  change,  the  COVID-  pandemic,  issues  of  international  peace, security and sustainable development. With this, let me complete my speech by wishing success to the works of the 76th session of the UN General Assembly. Thank you for attention.          "
68,2021,AZE,Azerbaijan,"President of the Republic of Azerbaijan The General Debate of the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly  Theme: “Building resilience through hope - to recover from COVID-, rebuild sustainability, respond to the needs of the planet, respect the rights of people, and revitalize the United Nations”  September 2021 Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General,  Distinguished Heads of State and Government,  I congratulate Mr. Abdulla Shahid on his election as the President of the 76th session of the United  Nations  General  Assembly  and  wish  him  every  success  in  fulfilling  his  duty.  I  also express my sincere gratitude and appreciation to Mr. Volkan Bozkir from brotherly Turkey for his leadership as the President of the 75th session of the General Assembly.   The COVID- pandemic continues posing serious challenges for the whole world. From the very beginning, our government has been taking robust and practical measures to protect the population and to minimize negative impact of the pandemic.  Azerbaijan has launched immunization campaign since mid-January this year. Vaccine doses used per 100 people makes more than  percent.  The socio-economic stimulus package worth almost $. billion has been released to support COVID-affected people and business. As  a  result  of  well-planned  measures,  the  situation  with  pandemic  has  been  kept  under control  and  the  quarantine  regime  has  been  gradually  eased  in  our  country.  Azerbaijan’s extensive  efforts  against  the  pandemic  have  been  internationally  recognized.  In  2020,  the          World  Health  Organization  hailed  Azerbaijan  as  an  exemplary  country  in  fighting  the pandemic. Azerbaijan carried out all these activities with its own financial resources. We have also made voluntary financial contributions to the World Health Organization in the amount of $ million and provided financial and humanitarian assistance to more than  countries to support their fight  against  the  coronavirus.  Furthermore,  we  have  provided  more  than  150 000  vaccine doses to  countries, free of charge.   Azerbaijan  is  advocating  for  a  stronger  global  solidarity  to  overcome  the  pandemic.  In  its capacity as the chair of the Non-Aligned Movement, Azerbaijan has put forward a number of global  initiatives.  In  May  2020,  Azerbaijan  held  Summit-level  Meeting  of  the  Non-Aligned Movement’s Contact Group in response to COVID-. During the Summit, I suggested, on behalf  of  the  Non-Aligned  Movement,  the  convening  of  the  Special  Session  of  the  United Nations General Assembly in response to coronavirus at the level of the heads of state and government.  This  initiative  was  supported  by  more  than  150  UN  Member  States  and  the Special Session took place on - December 2020. I express my gratitude to the Secretary-General Mr. Antnio Guterres and all States supporting our initiatives.   On numerous occasions, Azerbaijan has publicly expressed its discontent with stockpiling of vaccines  by  some  wealthy  countries.  We  reiterate  our  dismay  on  the  persistent  “vaccine nationalism”  and  deepening  inequality  in  access  to  vaccines  between  developing  and developed  countries.  Such  actions  prevent  developing  countries  from  protecting  their populations. According to international reports, so far, more than   percent of the world’s vaccine doses have been purchased by  wealthy countries, while vaccine coverage of low-income countries is less than  percent.  To  call  international  attention  to  this  challenge,  Azerbaijan,  on  behalf  of  the  Non-Aligned Movement, initiated a resolution on ensuring equitable and universal access for all countries to vaccines in the UN Human Rights Council, which was unanimously adopted this March.  Azerbaijan plans to initiate a resolution at the UN General Assembly on the same topic during this session. We believe that there is a need to take strong, cohesive and targeted global actions to recover better from the COVID-. In this regard, we suggest establishing a UN High-Level Panel on Global  Recovery  from  the  COVID-,  which  could  prepare  recommendations  on  global measures for post-pandemic period.  This year marks the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the Non-Aligned Movement. With a unanimous decision of 120 NAM Member States, Azerbaijan undertook the responsibility to  chair  the  Movement  for  three  years  at  its  18th  Summit  of  the  Heads  of  State  and Government held in Baku in October 2019. Azerbaijan is strongly advocating for upholding international justice, norms of international law and defending legitimate interests of Member States  of  the  Movement.  This  year,  the  Member  States  of  the  Movement  unanimously decided to extend Azerbaijan’s chairmanship for one more year until late 2023. It is a sign of     recognition  and  appreciation  of  Azerbaijan’s  successful  and  effective  steering  of  the Movement in this challenging time for the whole world.  The  implementation  of  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals  is  of  particular  importance  for Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan is among  countries around the globe and is the first in our region that has submitted its third Voluntary National Review Report on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.  Scoring . out of 100 points possible on the SDG achievement index, Azerbaijan ranks 55th out of 165 countries in the 2021 Sustainable Development Report with the best result in the region.  The  report  highlights  Azerbaijan’s  progress  in  areas  such  as  poverty  reduction, healthcare, nutrition, women’s labor force participation, clean water and sanitation, access to energy, internet usage, threatened species survival, as well as improving population welfare and sustainable development of cities and communities. Azerbaijan actively participates in building regional connectivity projects, such as East-West, North-South,  North-West  transportation  corridors,  thus  becoming  one  of  Eurasia's  primary and reliable transport and logistics hubs. We have put into operation the Baku International Trade  Seaport  with  cargo  handling  capacity  of    million  tons  per  year,  which  can  be increased up to  million tons per year depending on the needs.  Azerbaijan ratified the Paris Climate Agreement, with a voluntary commitment to achieve a  percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to the base year 1990. Furthermore, we are exploring the possibilities for setting conditional targets for 2050 under the Paris Agreement. Currently the share of the renewables in the total energy capacity of our country is  percent. The target is to increase this number to  percent by 2030. Agreements have been signed with three major international energy companies to invest in the construction of three wind and solar power plants with total capacity of over 700 megawatts in the coming - years. One  of  these  projects  will  be  implemented  in  the  Eastern  Zangazur  region  liberated  from Armenian occupation during the -day Patriotic War. This 240-megawatt solar power plant will  be  so  far  the  major  foreign  direct  investment  project  in  the  liberated  territories  of Azerbaijan. I invite other international energy companies to come and invest in green energy in the liberated Azerbaijani territories.  I announced the recently liberated Karabakh and Eastern Zangazur as Green Energy Zone. The liberated territories of Azerbaijan have the proven potential of 7200 megawatts of solar energy and 2000 megawatts of wind energy.   Azerbaijan,  along  with  crude  oil  and  natural  gas,  recently  became  an  exporter  of  electric energy.  Today,  we  export  electric  energy  to    neighboring  countries.  Meantime,  domestic electricity consumption is rising due to population growth and economic development. During  months of this year non-oil industry of Azerbaijan grew . percent.  Ladies and Gentlemen,      Azerbaijani people is strongly connected to its roots, history, language and traditions. I have declared this year as a ""Year of Nizami Ganjavi"" on the occasion of the 880th anniversary of the great Azerbaijani poet. In XII century, Nizami Ganjavi propagated in his poetry the ideals and  values  such  as  peace,  justice,  humanism,  freedom  and  equality  which  coincide  with principles promoted and protected by the United Nations.  In  Azerbaijan,  we  cherish  and  support  multiculturalism  as  a  way  of  life.  Azerbaijan  is considered  as  an  example  of  tolerance  and  peaceful  coexistence  of  representatives  of various religious and ethnic groups living in our country.   The  UN  strongly  supports  ""Baku  Process,""  which  was  initiated  by  Azerbaijan  in  2008  to strengthen dialogue and cooperation between the Muslim world and Europe. The UN General Assembly's resolutions have recognized the World Forum on Intercultural Dialogue held in Azerbaijan regularly, as a “key global platform for promoting intercultural dialogue”.  Ladies and Gentlemen,    Last September, addressing the UN General Assembly I drew your attention to continuing occupation of territories of Azerbaijan by Armenia and aggressive statements and actions of the Armenian government. Today, a year later, I proudly say that Armenia was defeated on the battlefield and Azerbaijan put an end to the occupation.    Armenia, for about  years, kept under occupation almost  percent of the territory of our country.  The  occupation  was  accompanied  with  notorious  war  crimes  and  crimes  against humanity. Armenia committed Khojaly genocide in February 1992, killing hundreds of civilians including 106 women and  children. 1275 Azerbaijanis were taken hostage, out of which 150 are still missing. Khojaly genocide has been recognized by  countries. Ethnic cleansing carried out by Armenia resulted in more than one million Azerbaijanis becoming refugees and internally displaced persons. The UN Security Council adopted four resolutions in 1993 demanding immediate, complete, and  unconditional  withdrawal  of  armed  forces  of  Armenia  from  Azerbaijan’s  occupied territories. However, these and all other similar decisions adopted by relevant international organizations,  including  the  UN  General  Assembly,  Organization  of  Islamic  Cooperation, Non-Aligned  Movement,  OSCE,  Parliamentary  Assembly  of  the  Council  of  Europe  and European Parliament were ignored by Armenia.  While some resolutions of the Security Council are implemented within days, in our case they remained unfulfilled for  years, which is a clear manifestation of double standards. There is a need to join efforts to elaborate mechanism of implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions in order to avoid selective approach.  The OSCE Minsk Group was established in 1992 with the aim to find resolution to the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. It could be possible for the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs to accomplish their task if they would take resolute actions for compelling Armenia to end its military aggression against Azerbaijan. Throughout the conflict, Armenia with its attitude and actions demonstrated that its sole aim was to maintain the status-quo and consolidate the     occupation.  On  many  occasions  I  raised  the  necessity  of  imposing  sanctions  on  Armenia. Regretfully,  there  was  no  international  sanction  imposed  on  Armenia  to  enforce  the implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions. In 2018, the Kocharyan-Sarkisyan regime of war criminals was overthrown in Armenia. We had some hopes that the new government of Armenia would seriously engage in negotiations. We were ready to reciprocate any positive signal coming from Armenia. 2018-2019, it was one of the calmest periods in the former line of contact. However, the regime replacement in Armenia  was  not  followed  by  real  changes  on  the  ground  in  spite  of  Azerbaijan’s  positive actions.  The  new  government  of  Armenia  also  opted  for  the  continuation  of  occupation instead of peaceful neighborhood with Azerbaijan.  During the last  years of the conflict, Armenia deliberately destroyed the negotiation process. The  Government  of  Armenia  made  a  number  of  provocative  statements  and  actions  like saying “Karabakh is Armenia, and period” and “Not an inch of occupied land back”. The then defense  minister  of  Armenia  openly  threatened  Azerbaijan  with  new  aggression  and occupation  of  new  territories.  Armenia  put  forward  unacceptable  and  groundless  so-called seven conditions and demanded to change the negotiations format, to start from the “zero point” and to involve the puppet regime established by Armenia in the occupied territories in negotiation process. Attempt by Armenian government to change the format and substance of negotiations was unpleasant surprise for the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs, whose efforts were paralyzed by irresponsible and dangerous actions of Armenia.    Furthermore, in gross violation of international law, including Geneva Conventions, Armenia was blatantly implementing the policy of illegal settlement of people mainly from Middle East with Armenian origin in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan. Encouraged by the long-lasting sense of impunity, Armenia was also announcing construction of new roads from Armenia to occupied territories to further consolidate the result of its aggression and speed up the illegal settlement.  In July 2020, Armenia perpetrated military provocation along the state border with Azerbaijan. As a result of the artillery strike inflicted on Azerbaijan’s Tovuz district,  military servicemen and civilians were killed. Later  in  August  last  year,  Armenian  sabotage  group  attempted  to  penetrate  through  the former  line  of  contact  to  commit  terror  acts  against  Azerbaijani  military  servicemen  and civilians but it was successfully neutralized.  In my statement at the General Debate of the 75th Session of the UN General Assembly on   September  last  year,  I  had  warned  that,  “hostile,  Azerbaijanohobic  statements  and provocations  of  Armenian  leadership  demonstrate  that  Armenia  is  preparing  for  a  new aggression against Azerbaijan.”  Three  days  later  on  the  27th  September  last  year,  Armenia  launched  a  large-scale  attack against  military  positions  and  civilians  of  Azerbaijan.  In  response,  Azerbaijan,  using  its     inherent  right  of  self-defense  as  enshrined  in  the  article    of  the  UN  Charter,  started  a counter-attack on its own territories against Armenia.  During  days, armed forces of Armenia heavily shelled cities situated along the frontline, namely  Agdam,  Aghjabedi,  Beylagan,  Dashkesen,  Fuzuli,  Goranboy,  Tartar.  Armenia  also fired at Ganja, Barda, Mingachevir, Gabala, Siyazan, Khizi and other cities situated far away from the former frontline. One of missiles was intercepted by Azerbaijani Air Defense Forces in Khizi, close to Baku, which shows that the capital city Baku was also target of Armenian missile  attack.  Armenia  was  using  ballistic  missiles,  like  Scud  and  Iskander-M,  as  well  as forbidden white phosphorus and cluster munitions. These war crimes of Armenia resulted in more  than  100  civilians,  including    children  being  killed,  more  than  450  wounded.  More than    000  civilian  infrastructures,  including  private  houses  in  Azerbaijan  have  been destroyed or severely damaged.  Abided  by  the  fundamental  principle  of  international  humanitarian  law  on  the  distinction between  combatants  and  civilians,  Azerbaijan  never  reciprocated  Armenia’s  vicious  war crimes by targeting civilians.  Armenia  also  recruited  mercenaries  and  foreign  fighters  from  abroad  and  deployed  them against Azerbaijan.   During -day war Azerbaijan liberated a large part of occupied territories, including cities of Jabrayil,  Hadrut,  Fuzuli,  Zangilan,  Gubadly  and  Shusha.  In  total  more  than  300  cities  and villages  were  liberated  on  the  battlefield.  Armenia  had  to  sign  an  act of  capitulation  on   November 2020. Accordingly, Armenia was obliged to withdraw its troops from the remaining part of Azerbaijan’s territories, namely Agdam, Lachin and Kalbajar regions. Azerbaijan, itself, enforced  the  implementation  of  the  abovementioned  UN  Security  Council  resolutions, probably, it was the first case in the world since the establishment of the UN. Azerbaijan resolved the -year-long conflict and restored its territorial integrity and historical justice by military-political means. The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict was left in the past. There is no administrative territorial unit called Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan. We have created Karabakh and Eastern Zangazur economic zones by the Presidential decree signed on  July this year. Using this occasion, I would like to call on all the UN Member States and the UN Secretariat  to  avoid  using  legally  non-existing,  politically  biased  and  manipulative  names while referring to our territories.  The building of multi-layered defense lines and fortifications with long trenches, tunnels and bunkers by Armenia for years in the formerly occupied territories of Azerbaijan proves that Armenia did not intent to return those territories by any means.  During  almost  -year-long  occupation  Armenia  has  deliberately  destroyed  cities  and villages, looted and plundered all cultural and religious sites of Azerbaijan turning them into textbook  example  of  urbicide  and  culturicide.  After  the  Second  World  War,  probably, annihilation of cities in such a magnitude has not happened anywhere else in the world.  Azerbaijani  cities  and  hundreds  of  villages  have  been  barbarically  wiped  out  by  Armenia.     Armenia  attempted  to  erase  the  traces  of  Azerbaijani  people  living  in  these  territories  for centuries. Agdam city was destroyed to such an extent that it was called as ""Hiroshima of Caucasus"". After the liberation, our Army could not find a single safe building in Fuzuli city to raise the Azerbaijani flag. Out of  mosques in the territories which were under Armenian occupation,  have been razed  to  the  ground  and  the  remaining    have  been  severely  damaged  and  desecrated, including by being used as stables for pigs and cows in total disrespect to all Muslims of the world. Even the graveyards were desecrated, destroyed, and looted.  During  visits  to  liberated  territories,  foreign  diplomats,  representatives  of  international organizations  and  international  journalists  have  witnessed  the  barbarism  committed  by Armenia.  The  facts  of  the  full  destruction  of  cities  and  villages,  including  the  cultural  and religious heritage sites of Azerbaijani people has been widely documented and broadcasted by international media and independent experts.  Each  delegation  in  the  United  Nations  has  been  provided  with  an  illustrative  book  which contains  brief  information  and  photos  of  our  towns  and  villages  before  and  after  the occupation. It reflects the total destruction of religious and historic monuments of Azerbaijan. Armenia  has  committed  severe  ecocide  in  the  formerly  occupied  territories  of  Azerbaijan. ,000 hectares of our forests have been destroyed, cut down and taken away, soil and rivers have been polluted and contaminated.  Armenia  used  water  reserves  to  create  an  artificial  environmental  crisis  on  the  formerly occupied territories. In 2016, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe adopted resolution entitled “Inhabitants of frontier regions of Azerbaijan are deliberately deprived of water”  demanding  the  Armenian  authorities  to  cease  using  water  reservoirs  as  tools  of political  influence  or  an  instrument  of  pressure.  This  resolution  was  totally  ignored  by Armenia, which continued to use the Sarsang water reservoir as a tool of humanitarian and environmental terrorism. Armenia was intentionally opening the floodgates during the winter months to cause flooding in the surrounding areas and closing them in summer to deprive people and farms from water in the former frontline region.  Armenia  has  been  severely  polluting  transboundary  river  called  Okhchuchay  causing irreversible degradation of ecosystem of the area along the river in Azerbaijan. Regrettably, some foreign companies are also participating in this environmental crime.  Armenia illegally exploited natural resources, including gold and other precious metals and minerals of the formerly occupied lands and exported it to the international markets. Based on  solid  facts,  we  have  identified  companies  from  different  countries  illegally  exploiting Azerbaijan’s natural resources and conducting other illegal activities in the formerly occupied territories. We have already started taking legal actions against those companies. They will be  held  accountable  for  illegally  exploiting  our  natural  resources  in  the  formerly  occupied lands.     We have around  000 citizens registered as missing persons from the first Karabakh War. Armenia must provide us with information about their fate. We have solid proofs that almost all of them have been tortured and killed, and buried in mass graves by Armenian military in violation  of  international  humanitarian  law.  In  April  2021,  remains  of    civilians  killed  by Armenian war criminals have been identified in liberated Bashlibel village of Kalbajar district in a mass grave.  Armenia  must  bear  state  responsibility  for  military  aggression  and  other  grave  crimes committed against Azerbaijan under international law and the Charter of the United Nations. The despotic warlords, who came to power in Armenia as a result of coup d’etat and ruled for  years from 1998 to 2018, were completely doomed to failure in achieving their nefarious dreams and goals during the three-decade-long occupation of Azerbaijan’s territories. On the contrary, Armenia has become a failed state, as I had emphasized in my statement at the UN General Assembly in 2017. The country has been weakened to the extent that it cannot even guard its own borders by itself.  “Azerbaijanophobia” promoted by the government is on the rise in Armenia. Racist ideology cultivated in Armenian society based on ethnic hatred and demonization is the root cause of ethnic cleansing and unprecedented vandalism in the formerly occupied lands of Azerbaijan by Armenia.  Despite  the  regime  change  in  Armenia,  the  fascist  ideology  continues  to  dominate  in  the country.  Successive  Armenian  governments  have  glorified  Nazism  in  the  person  of  Nazi general  Garegin  Nzhdeh  who  has  been  turned  into  “national  hero”  in  Armenia.  While  the progressive world is fighting against the rise of neo-fascism, the then president of Armenia inaugurated the monument of Garegin Nzhdeh in capital Irevan in 2016. Azerbaijan defeated not only Armenian occupying forces, but also Armenian fascism. If we see again any danger to our sovereignty, territorial integrity and security of our people we will exercise our legitimate right to self-defense without any hesitation.    Ladies and Gentlemen, As we have left the conflict behind, large-scale construction work is carried out in the liberated territories.  Azerbaijan  is  building  new  cities  and  towns  from  the  scratch  by  applying  the modern urban planning and utilizing the concepts of ""smart city"" and ""smart village"".  All this work is being conducted with Azerbaijan’s own financial resources. To that end, $. billion has been allocated from the state budget only this year.      However, the main challenge is the vast presence of landmines planted by Armenia in the liberated  territories.  Since  the  signing  of  the  capitulation  act  by  Armenia  on    November 2020,  around    Azerbaijani  citizens,  including    journalists  were  killed  and  around  130 citizens were wounded. Azerbaijan is among the most heavily mined countries in the world. It slows down the reconstruction process in the liberated territories and return of  internally displaced persons to their homes.      Armenia refuses to release accurate maps of minefields. The accuracy level of the maps for three regions which Armenia had to provide is only  percent. The international community must force Armenia to provide us with accurate mine maps of all liberated territories.  As the conflict is over, Azerbaijan has already announced its readiness to embark upon the border  delimitation  and  demarcation  between  Azerbaijan  and  Armenia,  and  to  start negotiations on peace agreement with Armenia, based on mutual recognition of sovereignty and territorial integrity of each other. Such an agreement would turn our region into the region of peace and cooperation. However, we have not yet seen any positive reaction from Armenia regarding our proposal.  One  of  the  areas  that  can  serve  as  the  cause  of  peace  and  cooperation  is  transportation projects.  In  this  context,  the  Zangazur  corridor  connecting  mainland  Azerbaijan  with  its inseparable part Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic and Turkey will create new opportunities for our region.  Azerbaijan has created a new reality in the Southern Caucasus region which has to be taken into account by all. Armenia has to make a choice between regional cooperation and illegal and baseless territorial claims against its neighbors. The international community should also play its positive role in this regard and urge Armenia to realize that peace has no alternative. Any acts directly or indirectly supporting revanchism and militarization in Armenia must be ceased. We hope that long-awaited peace, security and stability will prevail in the Southern Caucuses, at last. Azerbaijan will continue its consistent efforts to contribute and to strengthen regional peace and development.  Thank you.       "
69,2021,CYP,Cyprus,"President, Your Excellencies,  Ladies and Gentlemen,  At the outset, I would like to congratulate the elected President of the seventy - sixth session of the General Assembly, His Excellency Mr.  Abdulla  Shahid,  and  the  Secretary  –  General,  Mr.  Antonio Guterres,  on  his recent re-election to a second five-year  mandate, and assure of my Government’s unwavering support to his mission. Excellencies,  This  is  the  ninth  consecutive  year  that  I  am  attending  the deliberations of the United Nations General Assembly. Deliberations that every year focus on important issues  regarding developments and challenges which are critical for humanity, with the aim, through collective action, to address them effectively        Taking  stock  of  our  declarations  and  decisions  over  time,  I  must confess  that  I  feel  -  like  many  of  you  -  a  deep  sense  of disappointment.  A  sense  of  disappointment  because  I  witness  a  widening  gap between words and deeds, between the auspicious declarations and commitments which are made and the results of the measures that we promise to deliver. In all honesty, how many times have we spoken about the need to address regional disputes, invoking the UN Charter, as well as the decisions and Resolutions of the General Assembly or the Security Council? To what extent the weakness or the insufficient implementation of our  decisions,  perpetuates  conflicts  and  encourages  violations, something which in turn proliferates humanitarian crises? How often have we spoken about the dire need to tackle major global challenges,  such  as  poverty,  hunger,  child  mortality,  social  and economic  exclusion,  lack  of  adequate  health  care,  shortage  of educational opportunities?        How compliant are we in the implementation of what we have agreed with  regard  to  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals  and  the  Paris Agreement on Climate Change? I  could  expand  into  numerous  other  problems  the  resolution  of which  could  have  been  possible,  had the  United  Nations implemented its relevant decisions.  That is why our collective and shared failure to decisively tackle the challenges I referred to, has led down and disappoint many people across the world, whose fundamental human rights and dignity are not adequately protected.   At  the  same  time,  it  has  also  led  to  the  rise  of  worrying developments,  such  as religious fundamentalism,  violent extremism, sectarianism, destruction of cultural heritage, civil war and ethnic conflict.  What is equally alarming is that the combination of the above  has led  to  the  forcible  displacement  of  millions  of  people  and  created unprecedented waves of refugees and migratory flows, which exert huge economic and  social pressures  on all countries and regions affected.        Unfortunately  -  and  we  have  to  be  honest  with  ourselves  -  selfish interests  hinder  the  founding  principles  of  the  United  Nations,  in which  the  humanity  has  vested  its  hopes  for  a  prosperous  and peaceful future.  In order to achieve this objective, there is only one answer:  Multilateralism, tangible solidarity and stronger partnerships, based on a positive agenda.   It  is  for  this  reason  that  we  lend  our  unwavering  support  to  the reform and revitalization priorities of the Secretary – General which aim  to  reinforce  the  effectiveness  of  the  Organisation  and  further advance  peace-keeping and  peace-building,  humanitarian assistance and long-term development and growth.  Ladies and gentlemen, What  I  have  just  referred  to,  is  by  no  means  meant  to  belittle  the numerous achievements of the work of the United Nations.            My  remarks  and  observations  aim  to  emphasize  the  need  to transform,  via  reforms,  an  Organization  that  will  give  real  hope  to those in need of international protection, to the quest for collective security, peace and development. To turn the United Nations in a much more effective Organisation. Ladies and gentlemen, My strong and honest words are not unintentional.  I stand here before you representing a country which, regrettably, still  endures  the  consequences  of  the  blatant  violation  of  the fundamental principles of the United Nations, as a result of the 1974 illegal military invasion of Turkey and the ongoing occupation. Ever  since,  both  the  United  Nations  General  Assembly  and  the Security Council, have issued numerous decisions and resolutions, calling  on  Turkey  to  end  the  illegal  occupation  and  withdraw  its occupying  troops,  establishing  at  the  same  time  the  basis  for reaching a comprehensive solution to the Cyprus problem.         Decisions and resolutions which - in the absence of resolve and the necessary means for the implementation thereof -  have led to the audacity of the invader who tries to be portrayed as a victim, instead of the perpetrator it actually is. It is not my intention to engage on a blame game, but I cannot leave unnoticed the absurdity of the Turkish rhetoric, which lies in their claim  that  the  efforts  for  a  compromise  have  been  exhausted  and the focus should now be on reaching a settlement based on the so-called “realities on the ground”. Let me remind You what the true realities on the ground are: . Is it not a fact that thirty – seven per cent of the territory of the Republic  of  Cyprus,  an  EU  member-state,  remains  under  Turkish military  occupation,  with  more  than  forty  thousand  troops  still  on the ground? .   Is it not a fact that after the Turkish invasion of 1974, one third of the Greek Cypriots were forced to leave their ancestral homes?        .   Is  not  a  fact  that,  while  the  Turkish  Cypriots  owned approximately fourteen per cent of the privately owned land, today they usurp thirty – seven per cent of the island? .     Is  it  not  a  fact  that  they looted  churches,  destroyed archeological sites and thousands of years of cultural heritage? .    Is it not a fact that they have killed thousands of people and embarked  on  all  kind  of  atrocities  and  still  today  almost  one thousand persons are missing? .     Is it not a fact that they have implanted hundreds of thousands of  Turkish  nationals  to  the  occupied  areas,  thus  altering  the demographic character of the island - turning the Turkish Cypriots into minority in the areas they occupy? .      Is  it  not  a  fact  that  they  have  never  implemented  the  1975 Agreement on the status of the enclaved persons, then more than twenty  –  three  thousand,  while  today  they  number  only  three hundred and fifty?         .    Is it not a fact that all the above crimes have been condemned by the European Court of Human Rights and the Council of Europe in a plethora of decisions, with Turkey failing to comply with even one ruling?  .     Is it not a fact that Turkey has established an illegal entity in the occupied areas, which is under its absolute political, economic, societal, cultural and religious control?  A  control  which  is  also  denounced  by  the  majority  of  Turkish Cypriots? An illegal entity described by the European Court of Human Rights as “a subordinate local administration” of Turkey?  .      Is  it  not  a  fact  that  Turkey  tries  to  equate  the  State,  the internationally  recognized  Republic  of  Cyprus  -  member  of  the United  Nations  and  the  European  Union  -  with  the illegal secessionist entity?  .   Is  it  not  a  fact  that  the  above  proclamation  of  the  purported secession  had  been  condemned  by  the  Security  Council  and considered legally invalid?        .  And is not a fact that the Security – Council called for its reversal and for all states and the international community as a whole, not to accept it or in any way assist it?  .      Is  not  a  fact  that  recently  with  the  Presence  of  President Erdogan in Cyprus they are trying to change the status of the fenced – city of Famagusta, contrary to the UN Council Resolutions and the condemnation of the international community? Ladies and gentlemen, During  his  address  at  the  General  Assembly  on  Tuesday,  the President of Turkey, Mr. Erdogan, stated, and I quote:  “We  hope  that  the  problems  regarding  maritime  boundary delimitation  will  be  resolved  within  the  framework  of  international law and good neighborly relations”. I wonder as to which international law Mr. Erdogan refers to. Is  it  not  a  fact  that  Turkey  refuses  to  abide  by  the  1982  United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which codifies relevant customary international law?           How  Mr.  Erdogan  understands the  settlement  of  disputes concerning delimitations? Is  he  referring  to  Turkey’s  own  arbitrary interpretation  of international  law  which  reduces  the  Exclusive  Economic  Zone  of Cyprus by fourty – four cent, at the expense of both Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots? President  Erdogan  also  spoke  of  the  need  of  maintaining  good neighbourly relations.  And I wonder, yet again: Which country had invaded and to date still occupies Cyprus?  Which country invaded Syria? Which country violates the sovereignty of Iraq?  Which country intervenes in the internal affairs of Libya?  Which country violates the sovereign rights of Greece?            Which country interfered in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict?  Excellencies,  The  narrative  also  put  forward  by  the  Turkish  side,  according  to which  all  efforts  to  reaching  a  compromise  have  failed  and  we should  seek  solutions  outside  the  UN  framework,  reinforces  the valid arguments that Turkey’s end game is not to solve the Cyprus Problem, but to turn Cyprus into its protectorate.  And I will elaborate.  In  his  report  of    September  2017,  about  the  outcome  of  the Conference on Cyprus at Crans Montana, on paragraph  the UN Secretary  -  General  correctly  assessed  that  all  internal  elements included  in  his  six  -    point  framework  were  almost,  or  about  to, solved.  Thus, whilst the aim of the Secretary - General to reach a strategic agreement was within close reach, the reason of the unsuccessful outcome  was  Turkey’s inflexible  stance  and insistence  on maintaining  the  anachronistic  Treaty  of  Guarantee,  the  right  of intervention and a permanent presence of troops.        Furthermore,  following  the  Conference  at  Crans  Montana,  in  line with our commitment to resume the peace - process, both leaders and the UN Secretary  - General reached a Joint Understanding on November  ,  2019  as  to  the  principles  which  should  guide  the resumption of a new round of negotiations, namely: -    The Joint Declaration of 2014,  -   -   Convergences reached so far, and,  The  six-point  framework  presented  by  the  UN  Secretary  -General at Crans Montana.   Following  the  above,  one  would  expect  the  next  step  to  be  the resumption of the negotiations. Nevertheless, with Turkish objectives being different, we witnessed blatant  interventions  of  Turkey  to  oust  the  leader  of  the  Turkish Cypriot community, with whom the above Joint Understanding was reached.  The  evident  goal  was  for  him  to  be  replaced  by  a  new  leadership which  reproduces  and  adopts  Turkey’s  position  for  changing  the agreed  basis  for  a  settlement,  with  the  ultimate  goal  being  a  two-state solution.       Thus,  it  is  clear  why  a  compromise  is  not  possible  to  reach  when one  side  deviates  from  the  UN  framework  or  annuls  agreements reached and aspires to a different form of settlement, contrary to the agreed  basis  and  the  good  offices  mandate  of  the  Secretary  – General.   Ladies and Gentlemen,  Part  of  the  Turkish  agenda  is  also  the  creation  of  new  faits accomplis  on  the  ground  in  Famagusta,  in  full  contravention  and violation of the  relevant UN  Security – Council  resolutions, and in particular five- fifty and seven eighty – nine. All such actions are clearly intended to destroy the prospects of a settlement based on the agreed UN framework.  Ladies and Gentlemen,  A  compromise  becomes  even  more  difficult  to  reach  when  new ideas put forward by our side, as asked by the Secretary – General and in an effort to move the process forward, are blatantly rejected.          I  have  proposed  the  decentralization  of  the  exercise  of  powers, which  we  deem  as the  appropriate  balance  between the enhancement  of  the  constituent  states’  essential  role  and  the unhindered functioning of the state, including at international level.  I  have  also  flagged  our  willingness  to  consider  the  option  of  a parliamentary system with a ceremonial head of state and rotating Prime Minister.  And more recently, I have even extended an invitation to the Turkish Cypriots  to  rejoin  the  state  institutions  established  by  the  1960 Constitution  of  the  Republic  of  Cyprus,  thus,  fully  implementing, mutatis mutandis, its relevant provisions.  It goes without saying that such an invitation is not meant to be an alternative to the agreed basis of the settlement.  It is meant to ease the Turkish Cypriot community back into the State pending  a  final  settlement,  provided  a  strategic  agreement  is reached, thus, fully participating in the evolution of the Republic of Cyprus into a Federal State.        This  proposal  should  also  be  assessed  in  conjunction  with  the package  of  game  changing,  win  –  win,  Confidence  Building Measures I proposed last December and unfortunately rejected by the Turkish side. Ladies and Gentlemen, What I would like to assure you is about my determination to set the negotiation process back on track, on the basis of the UN framework and the agreement reached ιn Berlin on November , 2019.  For us, there is only one Plan:  To  reach  a  settlement  on  the  basis  of  a  bi-zonal,  bi-communal federation with political equality, as set out in relevant UN Security Council resolutions and in line with the principles on which the EU is founded.  A settlement that will lead to a functional and viable State, without the  obsolete  System  of  Guarantees,  the  right  of  intervention,  the presence of foreign troops, or any kind of foreign dependencies.          A  settlement  that  will  equally  benefit  all  Cypriots,  Greek  Cypriots and  Turkish  Cypriots,  fully  respecting  their  human  rights  and contributing to the peace and stability of the region. My extensive reference to the Cyprus problem, Dear Friends, aims at highlighting the need to address the realities and issues before us,  on the  basis of values and principles of international law, and not on the basis of the law arbitrarily interpreted by the powerful. Excellencies,  The  chosen  theme  of  this  year’s  General  Assembly:  “Building resilience  through  hope  -  to  recover  from  COVID-,  rebuild sustainability, respond to the needs of the planet, respect the rights of  people,  and  revitalize  the  United  Nations""  –  is,  of  course,  very timely  and  relevant  to  the  momentous  challenges  that  we  need  to tackle. As  our  actions  are  interconnected  and  have  an  impact  on  one another, we, all the nations of the World, made a collective pledge to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, so as to address universal challenges, on which I have already alluded to, for the benefit of humankind.        At the same time, we must also all realize that we are at a defining moment as regards climate change. Taking into account the alarming projections concerning the impact of  climate  change  on  our  immediate  region,  namely  the  Eastern Mediterranean and the greater Middle East, Cyprus has undertaken a  coordinating  role  for  developing  a  Regional  Action  Plan, consisting  of two  distinct  components:  a  scientific  and, subsequently, an intergovernmental one. Ladies and Gentlemen,  It  would  be  amiss  if  I  don’t  refer  to  the  recent  developments  in Afghanistan.  We  share  a  collective  responsibility  to  uphold international humanitarian law, particularly as regards the protection of women and minorities.  We  also  need  to ensure  that  Afghanistan  does  not  become  a  safe haven  for  terrorism  and  extremism,  or  a  breeding  ground  for organized crime, weapons and drug trafficking and renewed waves of illegal migration.          Another region which is also considered synonymous with discord and strife is the Middle East and North Africa. In this regard,  Cyprus, as a strong  proponent of the ideal  that the Eastern Mediterranean and the greater Middle East can become an area of stability, peace and cooperation, strives to actively promote an enhanced network of regional cooperation.  Excellencies,  In concluding, please allow  me to stress that in a fragmented and multipolar  World,  we  have  more  than  ever  a  moral,  ethical  and political duty to promote the essence of human civilization, unite our strength to maintain international peace and security and establish conditions that can bring prosperity and welfare to all.  I  do  hope  that  next  year  we  will  be  in  a  position  to  be  proud  of ourselves because we have taken significant steps towards fulfilling that vision. Thank you very much for your attention.        "
70,2021,GEO,Georgia,"President, Mr. Secretary-General, Dear Colleagues, Ladies and Gentlemen,  On  behalf  of  the  Georgian  people,  it  is  an  honor  to  speak  here  at  the  United Nations General Assembly. The UN provides each member state a platform to voice  concerns  and  share  its  views  about  the  most  pressing  challenges  and opportunities of our time.  Today, I bring the same Georgian spirit of cooperation and global engagement that  motivated  our  country  to  join  the  UN  after  restoring  independence  thirty years ago.  While our democratic nation may be young, our values and traditions are deeply rooted.  We  have  survived  and  thrived  through  many  cycles  of  history  over thousands of years.   Our  history  has helped  forge  a tough,  proud,  and  resilient  people,  open  to  the world and finding our own way forward. Georgia is a diamond in the rough, still seeking to sharpen our edges to reveal the full potential of the nation. Situated at the crossroads of civilizations - where East meets West, North meets South - Georgia has always adjusted to meet new challenges at every turn in our past.                        I applaud the UN for going ahead with this General Assembly during a global pandemic.  Rather  than  not  meeting,  we  have  acknowledged  that  a  safe  and responsible gathering is more important now than ever.   The  importance  of  this  meeting  cannot  be  understated.  The  world  is  still  in  a vicious  fight  against  COVID-,  which  has  ravaged  the  globe  and  affected economies and livelihoods.  As we continue our effort to build back better from the pandemic with a sense of unity, we have to come together to meet the needs of the world. Georgia is grateful to the United States, the EU, and China, as well as the vaccine producers  -  who  provided  vaccines  to  safeguard  the  health  of  the  Georgian people. Working in common purpose, we will put an end to the pandemic and get back to forging a better, brighter future for the entire world.  I stand in front of  you representing a country that is full of determination and faith,  a  country  which  is  optimistic  but  always  looks  at  its  future  through  a pragmatic lens.  I  am  proud  of  our  membership  in  the  UN  and  the  work  the  UN  does  for humankind.  I am also proud of my country and the work of the governing Georgian Dream party to deliver a stronger democracy, a stronger economy, and a brighter future for our people. In bringing about the changes needed to keep pushing ahead, my government has a plan for 2030 that aligns perfectly with the UN's 2030 Agenda.   We stand for a more sustainable environment; protecting the rights of all people; greater economic fairness and resilience; and a revitalized UN, among many other aspirations shared between Georgia and the UN.   This sentiment of cooperation echoes the Report of the Secretary General on Our Common Agenda that outlines an ambitious plan for reinvigorated international cooperation and multilateralism.                I  believe  this  General  Assembly  should  work  on  these  recommendations  in  a determined and substantive way.   Closer to home, Georgian Dreams are becoming a reality. We have more than aspirations for the future, we aim to get the results our people demand today.  Even with the deep setbacks from Covid-, our economy is on the mend, growth is surging, jobs are being created, and we are once again one of the leading tourist destinations in the world. The world continues to recognize our economic, financial, and legal reforms.  Some notable rankings demonstrate the spectacular strides Georgia has made to become  one  of  the  leading  countries  in  the  region  and  in  promoting  robust economic development.  According to the World Bank, Georgia takes 7th position amongst 190 countries for Ease of Doing Business;  The Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom ranks us 12th amongst 184 countries;  And  according  to  the  Fraser  Institute's  World  Economic  Freedom  ranking, Georgia ranks 5th out of 165 countries, an improvement of  steps in the last year.  It  is  also  important  to  note  that  great  strides  have  also  been  made  to  advance anticorruption measures, freedom of the press, and human rights. Earlier this week, we heard U.S. President Joseph Biden call for increased global cooperation to meet our largest challenges. In Georgia, we not only share this sentiment, but we have - and always will - step up to answer the call.   We  may  be  a  small  nation,  but  we  have  made  outsized  contributions  to international  security,  fighting  alongside  our  allies  against  terrorism  and organized crime around the globe.  We did so in Afghanistan where  brave soldiers gave their lives, and numerous others were injured, for the cause of peace and freedom.                 Recently,  we  provided  a  transportation  and  logistics  hub  for  thousands  of evacuees from Afghanistan, and facilitated over  flights, while also accepting workers from many global NGOs and IFIs to temporarily work out of Georgia.  These  actions  underscore  our  response  to  the  call  for  cooperation  with  our partners and the results that can be achieved when we work together.  This summer, Georgia, alongside our United States partners, laid the groundwork for  the  release  of    Armenian  detainees  by  Azerbaijan.  At  the  same  time, Armenia provided maps of mined territories.  Our goal has always been to do what we can to support common action to advance the common good.   All  our  advances  have  one  simple  goal  in  mind:  European  and  Euro-Atlantic integration. We will not rest until we achieve EU and NATO membership.  This  means  we  will  continue  to  reform  and  modernize  every  aspect  of  our democracy and economy to align with the highest global standards. Our  path  to  European  and  Euro-Atlantic  structures  is  a  homecoming,  a civilizational choice. An absolute majority of our population strongly supports this destiny for our country. Our historic decision to join the European and Euro-Atlantic family is the core principle that guides our Foreign Policy.  Especially since 2012, Georgia has made great strides in advancing democracy, human  rights  and  the  rule  of  law.  All  are  fundamental  values  we  share  with European institutions.  We  have  prepared  a  comprehensive  action  plan  packed  with  initiatives  and reforms that will lead to our application for EU membership in 2024.  For that, I would like to thank our European and international partners that have shown strong and steadfast support to Georgia for all these years.  Since 2012, we have held  democratic elections and each one has been declared free and fair by international election observers. In fact, in a few days' time, we               will  once  again  be  holding  a  free,  fair  and  democratic  nationwide  municipal election.  Since  the  last  time  we  met  in  person  here  at  the  UN,  democracies  around  the world have been under pressure, if not assault.  Irrational and dark forces have been at work, often aided and abetted by outside saboteurs.  Regardless of the source, we must hold to the democratic path. Elections are often passionate and hard fought, and feelings run high. Yet when elections are free and fair, the winners must be gracious and those who lose must abide by the will of the people. If we cannot believe in elections, then democracy itself is in peril.  So, I call on everyone here today who cares for democracy, for progress, for free and fair elections, to participate with passion in your political system.  And when the dust has settled and a winner is declared, respect the will of the people, close ranks and work to move your country forward.  The challenge to democracy is not the only challenge facing us. In Georgia, we have achieved much, but more remains to be done. First and foremost, we must create more jobs.  At  the  same  time,  we  must  remain  dedicated  to  investing  in  education  and infrastructure;  eradicating  poverty;  strengthening  our  health  system;  and diversifying our industrial, service and agricultural sectors.  As I have outlined, Georgia is on the move. We are overcoming Covid, and have a long term plan in place to strengthen our democracy, economy and society.  Yet I am reaching out to you all today to put an end to the illegal occupation of Georgian sovereign lands by Russia.                     Not  only  is  Russia  occupying  %  of  Georgian  territory,  but  is  also  actively seeking  to  undermine  our  aspirations  to  join  the  European  and  Euro-Atlantic family.  While our commitment to be a true global citizen is unstoppable and cannot be hindered by outside forces, the very freedom we have fought so hard for is being challenged every single day.  On our very own soil in the Abkhazia and Tskhinvali regions, we are observing a  humanitarian  crisis,  and  the  responsibility  resides  only  with  the  occupying power. This year, the European Court for Human Rights ruled its verdict and found the Russian Federation guilty of occupying and exercising effective control over two Georgian regions, and responsible for human rights violations in Abkhazia and Tskhinvali.   Today,  I  call  on  the  international  community  to  act  in  concert  to  address  the violations  of  fundamental  principles  of  international  law  in  the  occupied territories.  And  with  joint  efforts,  facilitate  the  implementation  of  the  EU-mediated August 2008 Ceasefire Agreement.   Every day, Georgian land continues to be subject to creeping annexation and so-called borderization.  This includes kidnappings, illegal detentions, unlawful restrictions on freedom of movement,  and  deprivation  of  the  right  to  education  in  the  native  tongue  - particularly in the Gali region. During  COVID-, this made the medical evacuations virtually impossible.   All these actions carry an unbearable burden for those living on both sides of the razor-wired fences.  This must be seen for what it is: a pre-planned ethnic cleansing to drive ethnic Georgians out. This must be stopped. In the occupied territories, we have a real humanitarian crisis.                  While  on  other  side  we  have  land  that  is  being  cultivated,  where  the  younger generation  have  access  to  world-class  education,  top  level  infrastructure,  and thriving businesses.  We  want  to  see  the  same  opportunities  and  prospects  for  development  and prosperity for the young generation in the Abkhazia and Tskhinvali regions as well.  For this very reason, we developed ""A Step to a Better Future"", a peace initiative to  improve  the  livelihoods  of  people  living  in  the  Abkhazia  and  Tskhinvali regions.  We  believe  that  only  through  sustainable  peace  and  security  will  our  fellow citizens have a better future.  It is through peace and stability that economies can start to thrive, and people prosper together. That is why I want to address our Abkhaz and Ossetian brothers and sisters, and say that our true strength is in cooperation and unity, which is exactly why our foes want us divided and apart.  We  have  a  common  history  and  are  part  of  a  common  homeland  - SAKARTVELO.  We should jointly define our common future as well.  We  should  build  our  country  together  and  peacefully  turn  it  into  a  truly democratic, prosperous, and future-oriented European society.  From  a  geopolitical  perspective,  the  Black  Sea  region  is  growing  ever  more important. The Black Sea is on the front lines of a dynamic regional chess match. It is a microcosm of conflict management; if we can maintain peace and stability here, we can do so elsewhere. Therefore, our goal is to ensure peace and stability in the entire region. In the South Caucasus, I propose what I am calling the Peaceful Neighborhood Initiative to promote stability in our region.                 This  format  will  facilitate  dialogue  and  confidence-building,  and  lead  to  the implementation of practical solutions to regional issues of common interest with our US and EU partners.  Georgia stands ready to host an international gathering in Tbilisi to discuss the prospects  of  our  Peaceful  Neighborhood  Initiative,  involving  our  South Caucasian neighbors and international partners.  Let us begin with small steps to build trust, then we can move toward resolving other regional and global issues together.  A sustainable peace and a common strategic outlook for the South Caucasus will benefit  the  wider  Black  Sea  region  and  enhance  broader  European  and  global security. Let me conclude where I began: we are here today as a testament to the power of collective action.  Whether it is the fight against the pandemic, financing development to advance quality of life, or the need of collective action to maintain peace, we must act together to live together.  There is no other alternative.  I remain confident that working together we will succeed.  I thank you.              "
71,2021,ISR,Israel,"President. Distinguished  delegates, Israel is a lighthouse  in a stormy sea.  A beacon of democracy,  diverse by design,  innovative by nature  and eager to contribute to the world –  despite being in the toughest neighborhood  on earth. We are an ancient nation. Returned - to our ancient homeland, Revived - our ancient language, Restored - our ancient sovereignty. Israel is a miracle of Jewish revival. Am Yisrael Chai - the nation of Israel is alive,  and the State of Israel is its beating heart.  For way too long, Israel was defined by wars with our neighbors.   But this is not what Israel is about. This is not what the people of Israel are about.               Israelis don’t wake up in the morning thinking about the conflict. Israelis want to lead a good life,  take care of our families,  and build a better world for our children. Which means that from time to time, we might need to leave our jobs,  say goodbye to our families,  and rush to the battlefield to defend our country —  just like my friends and I have had to do ourselves. They should not be judged for it.  Israelis remember the dark horrors of our past,  but remain determined to look ahead,  to build a brighter future. ** Distinguished  delegates,  There are two plagues that are challenging  the very fabric of society at this moment, One is the coronavirus,  Which has killed over  million people around the globe,  the other, has also shaken the world as we know it—  It’s the disease of political polarization.  Both coronavirus and polarization can erode public trust in our institutions,  Both -  can paralyze nations        If left unchecked, their effects on society — can be devastating.   In Israel, we faced both, and rather than accept them as a force of nature,  we stood up,  took action,  And we can already see the horizon.  ** In a polarized world, Where algorithms fuel our anger, people on the right and on the left operate in two separate realities,  each in their own social media bubble,  they hear only the voices that confirm what they already believe in.  People end up hating each other.  Societies – get torn apart.  Countries broken from within – go nowhere.  In Israel, after four elections in two years, with a fifth looming, the people yearned for an antidote: Calm. Stability. An honest attempt for political normalcy.  Inertia is always the easiest choice.         But there are moments in time where leaders have to take the wheel a moment before the cliff,  Face the heat,  And drive the country to safety.  About a hundred days ago my partners and I formed a new government in Israel.  The most diverse government in our history.  What started as a political accident, can now turn into a purpose.  And that purpose is unity.  Today we sit together, around one table. We speak to each other with respect,  we act with decency,  and we carry a message:  Things can be different. It’s okay to disagree,  it’s okay—in fact vital—that different people think differently, it’s even okay to argue.  For healthy debate is a basic tenet of the Jewish tradition and one of the secrets to the success of the start-up nation.         What we have proven, is that even in the age of social media,  We can debate, without hate. ** The second great disease we're all facing is the  coronavirus, sweeping  the world. To overcome –  we going to need to make new discoveries,  gain new insights,  and achieve new breakthroughs. It all begins with the pursuit of knowledge. The State of Israel is on the front lines of the search for this vital knowledge. We developed a model, which fuses the wisdom of science with the power of policymaking. The Israeli model has three guiding principles:  One — the country must stay open  We all paid a huge price: an economic price, a physical price and an emotional price—for bringing life to a standstill in 2020. To bring economies back to growth,  children back to school,  and parents back to work,  Lockdowns, restrictions, quarantines  – cannot work in the long run.           Our model, rather than locking people down in passive sleep-mode,  recruits them to the effort. For example we asked Israeli families to carry out home-testing of their children so we can keep schools open—and indeed schools stayed open.  The Second Rule—vaccinate  early.  Right from the start, Israelis were quick to get vaccinated. We are in a race against a deadly virus and we must try to be ahead of it. In July we were the first to learn that the vaccines were waning—which  is what brought a surge in Delta cases. It was then when my government decided to administer a third dose of vaccine—the booster—to the Israeli public. It was a tough decision, given that at the time the FDA hadn't yet approved it.  We faced a choice to either drag Israel into yet another set of lockdowns,  further harm our economy and society;  or to double-down  on vaccines. We chose the latter.               We pioneered the booster shot. * Two months in I can report that it works:  With a third dose, you're  times more protected than with two doses, and  times more protected than without any vaccine.  As a result, Israel is on course to escape the fourth wave without a lockdown,  without further harm to our economy.  Israel's economy is growing, and unemployment is down. I'm glad that our actions have inspired other countries to follow with the booster.  The third rule – Adapt and move quickly.  We formed a national task force that meets everyday, to bypass slow governmental  bureaucracy,  make quick decisions and act on them right away.   Trial and error is key. Every day is a new day, with new data and new decisions.  When something works,  we keep it.  When it doesn't, we ditch it.            Running a country during a pandemic is not only about health.  It's about carefully balancing  all aspects of life that are affected by corona, especially Jobs and education. The only person that has a good vantage point of all of this – is the national leader of any given country.   Above all, we're doing everything in our power to provide people with the tools needed to protect their lives.  The ancient Jewish text, the Talmud, says that: ""Whoever saves one life, is as if he saved an entire world"", And that's what we aspire to do.  ** Distinguished  delegates,  While Israel strives to do good, we cannot lose sight for one moment of what’s happening in our neighborhood.   Israel is, quite literally, surrounded by Hezbollah, Shia militias, Islamic Jihad, and Hamas.  On our borders.  These terror groups seek to dominate the Middle East and spread radical Islam across the world.  What do they all have in common? They all want to destroy my country,              And they're all backed by Iran.  They get their funding from Iran,  they get their training from Iran, and they get their weapons from Iran.  Iran’s great goal is crystal clear to anybody who cares to open their eyes:   Iran seeks to dominate the region — and seeks to do so under a nuclear umbrella. For the past three decades Iran has spread its carnage and destruction around the Middle East, country after country: Lebanon. Iraq. Syria. Yemen. & Gaza.  What do all these places have in common?  They are all falling apart.  Their citizens — hungry and suffering.  Their economies —collapsing. Like the Midas touch, Iran's regime has the ""Mullah-touch"" —  Every place Iran touches —fails. If you think Iranian terror is confined to the Israel– you're wrong.   Just this year, Iran made operational a new deadly terror unit – swarms of killer UAVs armed with lethal weapons that can attack any place any time.          They plan to blanket the skies of the Middle East with this lethal force.  Iran has already used these deadly UAVs—called Shahed 136-- to attack Saudi Arabia, US targets in Iraq and civilian ships at sea, killing A Brit and a Romanian. Iran plans to arm its proxies in Yemen, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon with hundreds and then thousands of these deadly drones.  Experience tells us that what starts in the Middle East, doesn't stop there.   ** Distinguished  delegates, In 1988, Iran set up a ""death commission"" that ordered the mass murder of ,000 political activists.  They were hanged from cranes.  This ""death commission"" was made up of four people; Ebrahim Raisi - Iran's new president, was one of them. (Pause) Raisi's also oversaw the murder of Iranian children. His nickname is ""the butcher of Tehran"", because that's exactly what he did - butchered his own people.  One of the witnesses of this massacre, stated in her testimony, that when Raisi would finish a round of murder,           he'd throw a party, pocketing the money of those he just executed… and then would sit down to eat cream cakes. He celebrated the murder of his own people, by devouring cream cakes.  And now Raisi is Iran's new president.  This is who we're dealing with.  * Over the past few years, Iran has made a major leap forward,  in its nuclear R&D,  in its production-capacity, and in its enrichment.  Iran's nuclear weapon program is at a critical point. [pause] All red lines have been crossed.  Inspections — ignored.  All wishful-thinking  — proven false.  Iran is violating the IAEAs safeguard agreements — and it's getting away with it.  They harass inspectors and sabotage their investigations —  and they’re getting away with it.  They enrich Uranium to the level of % which is one step short of weapons-grade  material — and they’re getting away with it.         Evidence which clearly proves Iran's intentions for nuclear weapons in secret sites in Toorkooz-abad, Teheran & Marivan — is ignored. Iran’s nuclear program has hit a watershed moment;  and so has our tolerance.  Words do not stop centrifuges from spinning. [pause] There are those in the world who seem to view Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons as an inevitable reality,  or they've just become tired of hearing about it.  Israel doesn't have that privilege.  We will not tire.  We will not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon.  I want to tell you something:  Iran is much weaker, much more vulnerable than it seems.  It's economy is sinking,  Its regime is rotten and divorced from the younger generation,  Its corrupt government fails to even bring water to large parts of the country.              The weaker they are, the more extreme they go.  If we put our heads to it,  if we're serious about stopping it, if we use all our resourcefulness,  we can prevail.  And that's what we're going to do.  ** But not everything is dark in the Middle East.  Alongside worrying trends, there are also rays of light.  First and foremost the growing ties Israel is forging with Arab and Muslim countries.   Ties that began  years ago with Israel’s historic peace agreement with Egypt,  continued  years ago with Israel's peace agreement with Jordan,  and even more recently with the ""Abraham Accords"" — that normalized our relations with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco. More is to come.  ** At a ripe young age of , more and more nations are understanding  Israel's value and unique place in the world.  Some friends have stood with us since our founding.          The United States of America is a long time, trusted friend of Israel, as we saw, yet again—just a few days ago in congress.  Alongside our old friends, we are gaining new friends — in the Middle East and beyond.  Last week this manifested itself with the defeat of the racist, anti-Semitic, Durban conference. This conference was originally meant to be against racism,  but over the years turned into a conference  of racism — against Israel and the Jewish people.  And the world's had enough of this.  I thank the  countries (!) who chose truth over lies, and skipped the conference.  And to those countries who chose to participate in this farce, I say:  Attacking Israel doesn’t make you morally superior, fighting  the only democracy in the Middle East doesn’t make you ""Woke"", adopting clich's about Israel without bothering to learn the basic facts, well.. that's just plain lazy.  Every member state in this building has a choice.  It’s not a political choice, but a moral one.  It’s a choice between darkness and light.          Darkness that persecutes political prisoners, murders the innocent, abuses women & minorities, and seeks to end the modern world as we know it. Or light — that pursues freedom, prosperity and opportunity. ** Over the past  years, the State of Israel — the people of Israel — have achieved so much in the face of so much.  And yet, I can say with full confidence:   Our best days are ahead of us. Israel is a nation of great hope,  a nation that has brought the heritage of the Torah to life in modern-day Israel, a nation of an unbreakable  spirit. ןמ ךשוחההחודA bit of light dispels much darkness.  הברהטעמ רואהןמ .  The lighthouse among the stormy seas –  Stands tall,  Stands strong,  And her light shines brighter than ever. Thank you.                              "
72,2021,PSE,State of Palestine,"President of the State of Palestine United Nations General Assembly General Debate of the 76th Session  September 2021 In the name of God the most compassionate and merciful. H.E. Mr. Abdullah Shahid, President of the United Nations General Assembly H.E. Mr. Antnio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations Excellencies Heads of Delegations and Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, This year marks the 73rd anniversary of the Nakba. More than half the Palestinian people were uprooted from their land and deprived of their property in that time. Myself, my family and many others still possess the deeds to our land. These deeds are registered as part of the United Nations’ records. Here is that deed, and many Palestinians carry theirs, as they still hold onto the keys of their houses to this day. We have not been able to recover our properties due to Israeli laws that disregard international law and violate United Nations resolutions, which affirm the right of the Palestine refugees to return to  their  homeland  and  to  recover  their  properties  and  receive  just  compensation,  most  notably  as enshrined in General Assembly resolution 194 (III).   Contravening  those  rights,  Israel,  the  occupying  Power,  enacts  laws  and  holds  court  hearings  to unlawfully and forcibly displace Palestinians from Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan in Jerusalem, which can only be characterized under international law as ethnic cleansing, which is rejected by our people and the international community as a whole and constitutes a crime under international law.  This  year  also  marks  the  passing  of    years  since  Israel’s  military  occupation  of  the  rest  of  the Palestinian territory in the West Bank, including, East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip in 1967.  This occupation persists despite having concluded an agreement of principles – known as the “Oslo Agreement”  –  to  achieve  peace  and  mutual  recognition  with  Israel  in  1993.  While  we  remained committed to all of its elements to this day and agreed to every call and initiative to achieve a political solution on the basis of international legitimacy, including the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative and the 2003 Quartet Roadmap, Israel has not honored its obligations under the signed agreements and has evaded participating in peace initiatives and instead pursued its expansionist, colonial enterprise, destroying the prospect of a political settlement based on the two-State solution.  To those who claim there is no Palestinian partner for peace and that we do not “miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity”, I challenge them to demonstrate that we have rejected even once a genuine and serious initiative to achieve peace, and I accept the judgement of the world in this regard.  Ladies and Gentlemen,  Does the Israeli occupying Power believe that it can elude its responsibility for the crime of uprooting more  than  half  of  the  Palestinian  people  from  their  land  and  for  committing  numerous  massacres, killing and maiming thousands of Palestinians in 1948, in Bald el-Sheikh, Deir Yassin, Abushusha,             Tantoura, Ein Zaytoun, Kabia and others and the subsequent destruction of over 500 Palestinian towns and villages? Does Israel believe it can simply ignore the legitimate rights, including political rights, of millions of Palestinians within and outside of Palestine, the owners and sons and daughters of this land, at the heart of it Jerusalem? Does it believe it can continue its policies to steal their land, suffocate their economy and prevent them from breathing the air of freedom? Does Israel believe it can endlessly promote a false narrative that ignores the historic and present right of the Palestinian people to their homeland? The crimes and aggressive policies of the Israeli occupying Power against our people, land and holy sites will not  thwart our people’s struggle to achieve their freedom  and  independence  on  their  land.  This  colonial  regime  it  has  established  on  our  land  will disappear,  regardless  of  how  long  it takes.  We  will  not  allow  them to  hijack  our  lives  and  kill our people’s dreams, hopes and aspirations to realize freedom and independence.  Ladies and Gentlemen,  It is regrettable that the policies of the international community and the decisions of the relevant United Nations bodies regarding a solution for the Question of Palestine have until now not been upheld and implemented,  resulting  in  a  failure  to  hold  Israel  accountable  and  sanction  it  for  its  violations  of international law, allowing Israel, which claims to be a democratic State, to act as a State above the law.  There are still some countries that refuse to acknowledge the reality that Israel is an occupying Power, practicing apartheid and ethnic cleansing. These countries proudly state that they have shared values with Israel, what shared values are you referring to? This has emboldened Israel, only furthering its arrogance and allowing it to reject and violate all UN resolutions. At the same time, there are those who demand from the Palestinian people and institutions, who believe in the culture of peace and the rule of law, to provide explanations and justifications to demonstrate they  do  not  incite  hatred  and  promote  violence.  For  example,  we  have  to  explain  and  justify  what appears in our curriculum, which reflects our narrative and national identity, while no one is demanding to  review  the  Israeli  curriculum  and  media,  so  the  world  can  see  the  real  incitement  by  Israeli institutions. We reject these double standards.  Why should we have to clarify and justify providing assistance to families of prisoners and martyrs  who are the victims of the occupation and its oppressive policies? We cannot abandon our people and we will continue striving to free all our prisoners. And I salute here the prisoners’ heroic stand. If the occupation  ends,  there  will  no  longer  be  a  prisoners’  issue.  I  cannot  but  wonder  as  I  address  the universal  conscience,  is  there  anyone  on  this  earth  who  would  punish  the  dead  and  prevent  their families from burying them except those who are deprived of morality and humanity?  Until  when  will  this  historical  injustice  against  our  people  continue?  Do  the  States  that  provide financial and military support to Israel, which it uses to prolong its occupation and kill Palestinians, or those that remain silent in the face of its aggressive policies, besieging and suffocating Palestinians, do these States actually believe they are ensuring peace and security for the Israeli people and stability for the region ? I say it loud and clear: they are not.  What more do you want from the Palestinian people? We have honored all our obligations under United Nations resolutions, we have pressured our people and ourselves to endure the suffering imposed on            us in the pursuit of hope, but all for what outcome? Historical events over the decades have proven that these international policies towards Israel are misguided.  Ladies and Gentlemen, As regards unifying our internal front, we reiterate that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) is the legitimate and sole representative of the Palestinian people, and that we are committed to the unity of  our  people  and  land  and  to  holding  legislative  and  presidential  elections  and  to  the  Palestinian National  Council  as  soon  as  holding  such  elections  in  Jerusalem  is  guaranteed  as  per  signed agreements.  We  call  on  the  international  community  to  help  us  bring  pressure  to  bear  upon  the occupying Power to ensure these elections are held in Jerusalem as we cannot continue being deprived of elections.  Let me state here that we did not cancel the elections, but only postponed them as we could not hold them in Jerusalem. Until this situation is addressed, we will continue striving to create the necessary conditions for the formation of a successful unity government so we can assist our people everywhere and implement reconstruction plans in the Gaza Strip, what requires a complete end to the aggression throughout the territory of the State of Palestine.  I  am  glad  to  reaffirm  that  the  coming  months  will  witness  the  holding  of  municipal  elections  in accordance with the law, and elections for all unions and universities are underway. Ladies and Gentlemen, As regards building state institutions, we stress that we have a full-fledged State with institutions that act in accordance with the rule of law and the principles of accountability and transparency, democracy and pluralism, respect for human rights and empowerment of women and youth. We have acceded to 115 legal instruments and international organizations, committed to upholding our people’s rights and strengthening  our  legislation  and  regulations,  including  as  they  pertain  to  human  rights.  We  will continue our endeavors to join international organizations. We have taken the initiative of working jointly with human rights organizations and civil society to preserve these national accomplishments and to guide and  adapt the work of our institutions on the basis of the rule of law.  I  have  issued  instructions  to  take  the  necessary  measures  to  correct  any  wrongdoing  and  continue upholding the rule of law, the freedom of expression and human rights as the path our country insists to remain on. I reaffirm to the international community our commitment to political engagement and dialogue as the path to achieve peace, and to peaceful popular resistance and to combating terrorism in all its forms and  origins  in  our  region  and  the  world.  We  have numerous  agreements  with  countries  around the world to combat global terrorism.  Ladies and Gentlemen,  I  wish  to  refer  here  to  the  constructive  dialogue  currently  underway  with  the  United  States administration to resume Palestinian-US relations and to undertake steps that will ensure the occupying Power’s abidance by signed agreements. From our side, we will strive to succeed in this endeavor so                 as to create conditions conducive to moving swiftly towards a final political settlement that ends the Israeli occupation of our country. However, the current and former Israeli governments have persisted in evading the two-State solution based on international law and UN resolutions, and insisted in pursuing occupation and military control over the Palestinian people while presenting illusionary economic and security plans as an alternative. These unilateral plans will not achieve security and stability for anyone as they undermine efforts for a genuine peace and prolong occupation and entrench the reality of one apartheid state. Ladies and gentlemen, This is a moment of truth with the occupying Power. We are at a crossroads. We have had enough. This situation cannot continue and our people cannot endure it any longer.  I have dedicated my life to achieving peace and chose the path of peaceful, legal and diplomatic work in international fora. We have extended our hands time and time again for peace and still we cannot find a partner in Israel that believes in and accepts the two-State solution. The leaders of Israel no longer feel any shame while stating their blunt opposition to this solution that is supported by global consensus. I warn that undermining the two-State solution based on international law and UN resolutions will open the way for other alternatives imposed on us by the situation on the ground as a result of the continuation of the Israeli occupation of our State; the absence of a just solution for the plight of  million Palestine refugees uprooted from their land in 1948; the systematic theft of Palestinian  land  and  the ongoing  crimes  of  the  occupation and  demolition of  homes as  a means  of collective punishment; the killings and arrests and detention by the thousands, including of women, the sick and children as well as the  imposition of the inhumane blockade over the Gaza Strip; and measures  annexation  under  numerous  pretexts  and  names,  including  the  settlement  plan  they  now invented  in  the  City  of  Jerusalem  and  that  we  fully  reject,  all  coupled  with  the  crime  of  forcibly displacing Palestinians from their land, as part of a policy of racial discrimination and ethnic cleansing pursued by the occupation in the absence of a deterrent international response. Our people will not surrender to the reality of occupation and it’s illegal policies and practices. They will  pursue  their  just  struggle  to  fulfill  their  right  to  self-determination,  and  options  are  available, including returning  to  a  solution  based  on  the  partition  plan  of  resolution  181  (II) adopted  in 1947 which gives the State of Palestine % of the land, double the space provided for on the 1967 borders. We  remind  everyone  that  Israel  seized  by  military  force  half  of  the  land  dedicated  to  the  State  of Palestine in 1948, which is a solution in conformity with international legitimacy.  If  the  Israeli  occupation  authorities  continue  to  entrench  the  reality  of  one  apartheid  state  as  is happening  today,  our  Palestinian  people  and  the  entire  world  will  not  tolerate  such  a  situation  and circumstances on the ground will inevitably impose equal and full political rights for all on the land of historical Palestine, within one State. In all cases, Israel has to choose. These are the options, and it has to choose.  Ladies and Gentlemen,  International law stipulates the right to a free and dignified life, and calls on States to take the necessary measures  to  protect  and  secure  this  right,  as  protection  constitutes  an  indispensable  and  decisive element for the maintenance of peace, security, stability, and development. In this regard, I call on the             Secretary-General Antnio Gutteres to work on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions on protection, including the resolution adopted during the General Assembly emergency session held in June 2018 under “Uniting for Peace” to take the necessary steps towards developing an international mechanism for protection, as foreseen in his report of August 2018, and to activate this mechanism on the borders of the occupied State of Palestine in 1967, including East Jerusalem, to avail our people of international protection.  In parallel, and in accordance with the same resolution, I call on the Secretary- General to convene an international  peace  conference,  in  line  with  the  internationally-recognized  terms  of  reference  and United  Nations  resolutions  and  the  Arab  Peace  Initiative,  and  under  the  sole  auspices  of  the international Quartet.  To ensure our initiative is not open-ended, we must state that Israel, the occupying Power, has one year to withdraw from the Palestinian territory it occupied in 1967, including East Jerusalem, and we are ready to work throughout this year on the delineation of borders and solving all final status issues under the auspices of the international Quartet and in accordance with United Nations resolutions. If this is not  achieved,  why  maintain  recognition  of  Israel  based  on  the  1967  borders?  Why  maintain  this recognition?  Moreover, in this regard, we will go to the International Court of Justice as the supreme international judicial body, on the issue of the legality of the occupation of the land of the Palestinian state and the relevant obligations for the United Nations and States around the world in this regard and all will have to respect the conclusions of the Court. Colonialism and apartheid are prohibited under international law and they are crimes that must be confronted and a regime that needs to be dismantled.  The international community’s support for this initiative, consistent with international law and United Nations resolutions, may save the region from an unknown fate. We all have a chance to live in peace and security, good neighborly relations, each in our State, and delaying implementation of these steps will keep the region in a situation of turmoil and instability with dire consequences. Do the leaders of Israel dream of maintaining their occupation forever? Do they want this occupation to last forever?  Ladies and Gentlemen, Why  should  a  Palestinian  continue  living  either  under  Israel’s  racist  occupation  or  as  a  refugee  in neighboring  countries?  Are  there  no  other  alternatives,  freedom  for  example?  The  Palestinian everywhere is a creative and dynamic human being and the entire world can testify to that. Palestinians deserve to live free in their homeland.  From this podium I call on the sons and daughters of Palestine everywhere around the world to continue pursuit of their peaceful and popular struggle that has shown the true image of the valiant Palestinian people striving for freedom and independence by resisting occupation and apartheid. I salute our people everywhere and salute all nations and countries that have stood in solidarity with our people during the Jerusalem uprising and the prisoners uprising and against the aggression that killed hundreds, spread destruction and displaced thousands of our people in the West Bank, Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip  I also salute all those who took part in demonstrations in the United States and Europe and everywhere across the globe to demand an end to the Israeli occupation, apartheid and ethnic cleansing and to call             for justice, freedom and self-determination for our people. This is an awakening, recognizing the true Palestinian story, and I urge all to continue raising and defending it and defending the Palestinian right to life, equality and statehood. Opposing aggressive policies and practices of the Israeli occupation and settlers and of the Zionist narrative in general is not an act of incitement or anti-Semitism, but rather the duty of every free man and woman in the world.  In this connection, I convey to the international community  our gratitude and appreciation for their political and material support to our people and for the building our institutions and national economy. But the time has come to take tangible steps to revive hope and end the Israeli occupation of our land and people and to consecrate the values of justice and peace in our region. I wonder what prevents countries that recognize Israel from recognizing the State of Palestine, since they support the two state solution?  I say to Israel’s leaders: do not oppress and corner the Palestinian people and deprive them of dignity and their right to their land and State as you will destroy everything. Our patience and the patience of our people have limits. I reiterate yet again that the Palestinian people will defend their existence and identity and will not kneel or surrender, they will not leave and will remain on their land defending it, defending their fate and pursuing their great journey towards ending the occupation. Of the land of the State of Palestine and its capital East Jerusalem. We say once more: this is our land, our Jerusalem, our Palestinian identity, and we shall defend it until the occupier leaves, as the future belongs to us and you cannot claim peace and security for yourselves alone. Let us be. Peace be upon you.      "
73,2021,BGR,Bulgaria,"President  of  the  United  Nations  General  Assembly  during  its  75th  session,  and  my  high appreciation for the way he conducted the  work of the Assembly under the unprecedented conditions imposed by the COVID- pandemic.  I would also like to congratulate the President of the  General Assembly for the current 76th session, His Excellency Abdulla Shahid, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Maldives, who visited my country recently, and wish him every success in his future endeavor still challenged by the coronavirus. I would like to begin by quoting the late former UN Secretary-General Kofi Anan: “More than ever before in human history, we share a common destiny. We can master it only if we face it together. And that, my friends, is why we have the United Nations.” The raging COVID- pandemic in many parts of the world, and several, mostly unprecedented global  challenges  we  are  facing  at  the  very  same  time,  raised  the  need  for  all  countries  to support  a  more  effective  and  coherent  rules-based  multilateral  approach  with  the  United Nations system at its core. Multilateralism is the key to our future and has no alternative. For Bulgaria, this is a high priority, and we support the deepening of EU’s strategic partnerships around  the  world,  as  well  as  its  more  active  engagement  with  third  countries  and  regional organizations.   The most urgent tasks ahead of us are: • • • • to prevent  the spread of the coronavirus; to focus on the global economic recovery, decreasing growing economic disparities;  to accelerate progress in climate change and sustainable development; to combat terrorism and trans border crime, as well as enhancing cybersecurity. MR. PRESIDENT, It is vital that we all stand in support and solidarity with the most vulnerable countries and people  around  the  globe,  under  the  guidance  of  the  United  Nations  and  the  World  Health Organization. My country, Bulgaria, has joined the efforts to provide vaccines to those in need by sharing its excess supplies through EU mechanisms and on a bilateral basis.  COVID-  pandemic  and  climate  change  combined  resulted  in  wasting  an  entire  decade  of progress in the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in many parts of the world. There is no doubt that the sustainability cannot be achieved without dealing with the effects of climate change, environmental degradation, and loss of biodiversity.  To  maximize  our  collective  response,  we  must  build  resilience.  We  have  to  enhance  the security of our supply chains, the critical infrastructure, the energy networks, as well as our preparedness for pandemics and natural disasters. Our efforts  must be directed against the increasingly  frequent  and  severe  malicious  cyber-attacks  exploiting  vulnerabilities  of  our democratic societies.  MR. PRESIDENT, Bulgaria is deeply concerned by the persisting threats to security and stability in numerous parts of the world. The situation in Afghanistan, the Middle East, the continuing crisis in Ukraine, are only some of them.  We share the grave concern over the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan after the  Taliban  takeover,  threatening  to  jeopardize  the  political,  economic,  and  social achievements by that country over the past  years. The risk to the stability and security extends  to  the  whole  region  and  far  beyond.  Bulgaria  condemned  the  attacks  near the International Airport in Kabul on  August 2021.  The attacks, claimed by Islamic State in  Khorasan  Province, resulted  in  the  death  and  injuries  of  over  300  civilians,  including women and children, and military personnel. Terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security.  All States must  combat  terrorism  through  concerted  multilateral  efforts,  and  by  all  means,  in accordance  with  the  Charter  of  the  United  Nations  and  other  obligations  under international law. As  an  EU  Member  State  Bulgaria  supports  EU’s  commitment  to  work  with  international partners  on  durable  solutions  for  Afghan  refugees  and  address  the  needs  of  countries hosting large numbers of them. As a sign of solidarity, we took a decision to receive up to  Afghan citizens who have worked for Bulgaria, EU or NATO missions, and their families.  Bulgaria  shares  the  view  that  a  continued  humanitarian  engagement  in  Afghanistan  is essential  to  respond  to  the  unfolding  humanitarian  crisis  fueled  by  the  conflict,  the  severe drought and COVID- pandemic.  Let  me  now  turn  to  the  Middle  East.  We  condemn  the  missile  attacks  on  Israel  and  the unproportioned  use  of  force  in  retaliation  while  we  fully  recognize  Israel’s  right  to  self-defense.  We  are  deeply  concerned  by  the  violence  in  the  Occupied  Palestinian  Territory since the deadly escalation between Israel and the militants in Gaza earlier this year, and the continued loss of life and serious injuries as reported to the Security Council by the UN Special Coordinator on the Middle East Peace Process.  The solution of the conflict between Israel and Palestine through the revival of the Middle East Peace Process  has no alternative. We call on both sides to  use maximum restraint,  refrain from unilateral acts and provocations, and give a chance to negotiations and dialogue as well as to confidence-building measures.     Bulgaria  has  high  appreciation  for  the  work  of  the  United  Nations  Agency  on  Palestinian Refugees on the ground, and will continue to support it both politically and financially. In accordance with the fundamental principles of international law, Bulgaria continues to call for resolving the crisis in Ukraine on the basis of full and comprehensive implementation of the Minsk Agreements.  In the context of the ongoing pandemic, we need to ensure the respect for human rights, since they  are  of  utmost  importance  for  achieving  security,  prosperity  and  peace.  Protection  of children's  rights  is  a  key  priority  of  my  country  with  regard  to  human  rights,  with  a  strong emphasis  on  the  inclusive  education  for  children  with  disabilities  and  the  process  of deinstitutionalization.  Further,  we  insist  on  the  empowerment  of  women  and  girls,  the promotion  of  rights  of  people  with  disabilities,  as  well  as  the  fight  against  antisemitism, islamophobia and hate speech.  To  promote  these  priorities  on  a  global  level,  Bulgaria  supports  all  relevant  UN  funds  and programs,  the  UN  High  Commissioner  for  Human  Rights,  and  actively  engages  with  the  UN system, currently as member of the Human Rights Council.  We  need  a  revitalized  United  Nations  to  effectively  address  the  numerous  challenges  the world is facing today. To this end, Bulgaria will continue to work for efficient United Nations, adequately prepared to respond to the needs of humanity in the 21st century. We support the comprehensive reform in all areas of activity of the Organization.  Bulgaria welcomes the report of the Secretary-General “Our Common Agenda”.  We especially commend the fact that it is future-oriented with a strong focus on youth, since the decisions taken today will shape life of future generations. Bulgaria  is  strongly  committed  to  its  financial  obligations  to  the  United  Nations  and  is concerned  about  the  persisting  liquidity  challenges,  which  undermine  the  ability  of  the Organization to implement its mandates and to carry out its work.  MR. PRESIDENT, In  concluding,  let  me  be  optimistic.  At  the  very  outset  of  the  World  Organization,  Ralph Bunche, a renowned American political scientist and diplomat, a leading civil rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate for his mediation in Israel in the late 1940s, said: “The United Nations  is our  one great hope for  a peaceful and free world.” I would like to  add  – the United Nations is our one great hope for safely steer the boat of our common destiny through the troubled and uncharted waters of our future, and we all must stand as one in its support. THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.     "
74,2021,CZE,Czechia,"President, Mr Secretary-General, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, Two  weeks  ago,  we  were  commemorating the  20th  anniversary  of the horrendous terrorist attacks against the United States. But this barbaric act of terrorism was not only directed against the US but also against our shared values. This crime will always serve as a powerful reminder that we must stand united in the fight against terrorism and violent extremism in all their forms.  The threat of international terrorism has unfortunately not diminished. Terrorist and  violent  extremist  groups  have  demonstrated  their  ability  to  adjust  to  the  new circumstances, even during the COVID- pandemic.  Our vigilance is therefore needed more than ever.  The adoption of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy Review last June gives us an opportunity  to  adapt  and  improve  the  tools  required  to  effectively  address  this global scourge.  The turbulent situation in Afghanistan poses a major challenge. It is now important to join forces to avert a humanitarian catastrophe; to continue our fight against terrorism  and  organized  crime;  and  to  prevent  forced  displacement  and  illegal migration.  At  the  donor  conference  in  Geneva  the  Czech  Republic  pledged  to  increase  its humanitarian  support  for  the  people  in  need  in  Afghanistan.  Our  contribution  will amount to some  milion US Dollars.  The UN remains a key actor on the ground. The Taliban must ensure an unhindered and safe access to the entire territory of the country for all humanitarian and UN staff, including all female staff. The  Czech  Republic  strongly  condemns  the  use  of  violence  and  intimidation against  protesters,  journalists  and  human  rights  defenders.  We  are  particularly concerned by actions of the Taliban directed against women and girls.  Another region where  the population has been badly tested  is  the  Sahel.  Together with our international and African partners, the Czech Republic will continue to take   part in joint stabilization activities to bring peace and prosperity to that part of the continent.  Africa deserves peace, prosperity and stability!  We have been implementing a national programme with the annual budget of over  million  US  Dollars  which  supports  African  countries  coping  with  forced displacement and with irregular migration. Mr President, The COVID- pandemic has had a devastating impact on individuals, societies and economies.  It  has  shown  us  how  intertwined  global  challenges  are.  It  has  also highlighted  the  importance  of  international  cooperation,  information  sharing  and communication among all actors as well as compliance with international obligations.  The World Health Organisation has a special role in strengthening health systems and preparedness for pandemics. It has a unique mandate in the field of global public health. It must be able to work effectively, efficiently and independently of any political or other influence.  The  ongoing  reform  process  in  the  WHO  should  reflect  the  recommendations  of evaluation  bodies  and  feed  into  the  notion  of  value-for-money.  We  must  learn  our lessons and act in solidarity to leave no one behind.  As part of Team Europe, my country will have donated more than  million doses of vaccines by the end of 2021, mostly through the COVAX facility. Ladies and gentlemen, We  can  build  back  better  and  greener  if  we  connect  our  immediate  pandemic response with prevention and resilience building.        The  2030  Agenda  for  Sustainable  Development  and  the  Paris  Agreement  on Climate  Change  constitute  the  centrepiece  of  our  joint  efforts.  The  nexus  of humanitarian, development and peace activities has proved efficient.  Earlier  this  year  my  country  has  successfully  presented  its  second  Voluntary National Review in the UN. We support our partners in achieving the goals of the 2030 Agenda through projects of bilateral and multilateral development cooperation, humanitarian assistance and transformation policy.  As regards the global climate action, the COP  in Glasgow will be crucial and our nationally  determined  contributions  need  to  be  ambitious.  We  also  need  all  major emitters on board.  The impacts of climate change on peace and security are becoming increasingly apparent. A systematic integration of these risks into the UN Security Council’s work is necessary. Unfortunately the Covid- pandemic has accelerated negative trends in the protection of  human  rights  worldwide.  More  than  ever,  we  need  to  ensure  respect  for  civic participation, the independent media and civil society  Mr. President, The  increasing  importance  of  cyberspace  to  our  everyday  lives  and  our  economic resilience cannot be overstated these days. Preserving a globally accessible, free, and secure cyberspace is essential. However, the pandemic has also exposed deep digital divides. We are appalled by the increase of cyber-attacks against critical infrastructure delivering  essential  services  to  our  citizens,  including  hospitals,  water  treatment facilities, power plants, and even our democratic institutions. Such acts can cause grave suffering to civilians, including the loss of lives.  Deliberate spreading of disinformation has a direct impact on health and safety of our  citizens  and  their  trust  in  institutions.  Using  disinformation  as  a  means  of aggression against other states is utterly unacceptable. The  geopolitics  of  technology  continues  to  pose  an  ever-greater  challenge  to  the established  norms.  We  must  all  work  together  to  ensure  that  new  digital   technologies, including Artificial Intelligence, remain an enabler of human progress rather than a tool for surveillance, oppression and control.  Ladies and gentlemen,  Protection and promotion of human rights is a cornerstone of the Czech foreign policy.  We  support  the  mandate  and  the  vital  work  of  the  Office  of  the  High Commissioner  for  Human  Rights.  We    echo  the  Secretary  General’s  Call  to Action for Human Rights and we agree that an adequate funding of the UN human rights pillar from the UN regular budget must be secured.  Similarly, striving to improve the rights of women and girls must be at the heart of our response to the pandemic. The Czech Republic fully supports the Women, Peace and Security agenda and we proceed with the implementation of our Second National Action Plan along with civil society and academia. Furthermore, the Czech Republic firmly supports  international criminal justice and, in particular, the International Criminal Court. We would also like to express our support for the start of negotiations on the convention on crimes against humanity.  Let  me  underscore  one  strand  of  hatred  as  especially  despicable:  the  rising antisemitism  and  the  Holocaust  denial.  The  Czech  Republic  is  committed  to preventing and combating antisemitism both offline and online. In 2022, we will host a  follow-up  International  Conference  to  the  Terezn  Declaration  endorsed  by   countries. Our ambition is to achieve progress in rectifying property injustices from the time  of  the  Holocaust  and  to  create  funds  for  education  about  and  fighting  against antisemitism, xenophobia and hatred. Mr President, The  Czech  Republic  is  concerned  by  the  continuous  massive  repression  in  Belarus which has created a climate of fear in general public. We call for immediate release of       all  those  unlawfully  detained  for  exercising  their  rights  to  freedom  of  expression  or peaceful  assembly,  including  journalists,  human  rights  defenders  and  activists. Independent and transparent investigation into all these violations is essential.  The  Czech  Republic  is  a  firm  supporter  of  the  rules-based  international  order with the UN at its core, upholding international law and compliance with commitments rooted in the UN Charter. In this context let me reiterate the unwavering support of the Czech Republic to the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and independence of Ukraine and Georgia within their internationally recognised borders.  In addition, we deplore any state-sponsored malign activities committed in Europe in recent  years  as  simply  unacceptable,  illegal  and  in  direct  violation  of everything the UN stands for. The Czech Republic has experienced it first-hand.  Turing to Myanmar now, we strongly condemn the military coup in the country. We support the legitimately elected leaders and we call for respect of the results of the November 2020 parliamentary elections.  Mr President, Let me now focus on the situation in the Middle East. Hamas and other terrorist groups  in  Gaza  bear  the  primary  responsibility  for  the  outbreak  of  violence  and  the tragic  developments  in  May  2021.  Their  large-scale  rocket  attacks  targeted  Israeli civilians. Let me reiterate that Israel has every right to defend its citizens against terror.  The Czech Republic supports any meaningful initiative leading to an end to this cycle of violence and remains firmly committed to the two-state solution. Resuming direct talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians is desirable, as are all confidence-building measures aiming at bringing the two sides to the negotiating table.   In the Human Rights Council, the Czech Republic voted against the establishment of an  ongoing  Commission  of  Inquiry  with  a  rather  vaguely  defined  geographical scope. Israel, a democratic country with an independent legal system, has appropriate means to effectively confront and address human rights violations. Iran’s continued escalation of nuclear activities far beyond its commitments coupled with the suspension of the implementation of transparency measures under   the  Joint  Comprehensive  Plan  of  Action    raises  serioues  concerns.  All  these  actions impede the execution of the IAEA’s verification and monitoring mandate. Mr President,  We all are committed to ensuring a safer and more stable world for our citizens and a sustainable inclusive global recovery from the COVID- pandemic. Complex global challenges  can  only  be  addressed  by  effective  multilateral  governance  and rules-based international cooperation. Such  an  approach,  I  believe,  can  also  be  useful  in  reducing  simmering  geopolitical tensions  in  the   Indo-Pacific.  We  observe  this  worrying  trend  with  great apprehension.   In order to tackle the pressing global issues, the international community needs the UN to be fit for purpose. We welcome the Secretary General’s recent report “Our Common Agenda”. Engaging a broad array of stakeholders, including young people, civil society and think-tanks will provide fresh energy for change. In conclusion, I fully agree with the UN Secretary General that humanity has proven time and again that it is capable of achieving great things when we put our differences aside and work together for a common purpose. This is the spirit of our United Nations. Thank you.      "
75,2021,POL,Poland,"President of the Republic of Poland  at the 76th Session of the United Nations  General Assembly New York, September , 2021                                                                  Your Excellency, Distinguished Mr. President, Excellencies, Distinguished Heads of States and Nations,  Esteemed Delegates, I congratulate His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid on his election to the honorable function of the  President  of  the  76th  session  of  the  UN  General  Assembly.  I  would  like  to  express Poland`s full support for his mission and wish every success in its execution. I also want to thank  His  Excellency  Mr.  Volkan  Bozkır  for  his  active  presidency  over  the  works  of  the General Assembly in the previous session. Furthermore,  I  am  grateful  to  Secretary  General  Mr.    Antnio  Guterres  for  developing  the report  entitled  ""Our  Common  Agenda”,  which  provides  a  comprehensive  response  to  the most pressing challenges faced by the world today. Just like Mr. Secretary General I see the need for international solidarity in the Covid- vaccination process, just like him I can see the need for action on the climate crisis and the protection of biodiversity.   As  participant  of  numerous  debates  I  can  also  see  an  increasing  consciousness  of  mainly young  people  who  realize  that  the  decisions  taken  today  will  have  an  immense  impact  on their lives. I am delighted with this trend.  Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen,  I  am  standing  before  you  as  a  leader  of  a  -million-strong  Nation  who,  just  like  all  our states,  has  been  facing  up  to  an  unprecedented  pandemic  and  all  its  consequences  for almost two years now. Over the period of  months we have lost  thousand lives while almost    out  of    million  people  in  our  country  have  contracted  the  virus.  Although  our robust    economy  bravely  resisted  the  crisis  and  has  managed  to  come  back  to  an exceptionally dynamic growth today, during the first year of the pandemic it failed, for the first time in  years, to record such growth. I do not need to explain to you, the leaders of states, what it means for millions of families since you know the situation first-hand.  I am standing before you as one of more than 200 million people who have recovered from Covid-.  Like  surely  many  of  you  present  here  I  went  through  the  illness  which  befalls people  irrespective  of  their  function,  status,  religion,  convictions,  orientation  and  world views.  The past  months of fight against the pandemic reminded us of a word which we in Poland know since the cradle. That word is ""solidarity"". Many of you know what I am talking about. This  name  refers  in  our  history  to  a  large  independent  trade  union  established  in  1980  by workers  in  the  plants  who  went  on  strike  against  the  communist  regime,  and  who  in  the 1980`s  and  1990`s  inspired  millions  of  people  across  the  globe  in  their  fight    for  the   democratic  or  labor  rights.  This  word  has  come  to  be  a  symbolic  guiding  principle  of  our policy, its ideal.  Speaking about solidarity I am also thinking about solidarity in the context of COVID-. And this reflection is by no means an easy one. Especially in reference to us, the leaders of the rich world, of the affluent North.  Did we show enough solidarity? Did the mankind behave in the right manner throughout its fight against the virus? Did we offer help to each other as we should be doing according to our basic moral instinct as humans? I have serious doubts about it.  Did we, the rich North (since my country despite all its daily problems belongs to the limited group  of  affluent  states)    demonstrate  the  necessary  solidarity  with  the  countries  of  the South? Did we have an equal access to vaccines and other measures preventing the spread of the disease?  When the threat came, it was our first instinct to isolate ourselves from each other.  Borders reemerged in Europe. Those were unquestionably justified actions as none of us knew back then how serious the danger would really be. The situation was further exacerbated by the reports about tens of thousands of those infected and deceased. Every one of us remembers the horror of the first months of 2020, the huge hopes we attached to the development of a vaccine  which  would  protect  us  from  the  disease.  However,  it  is  today,  almost    years  on with over . million casualties, that we should answer the question how well we passed the solidarity test.  Ladies and Gentlemen,  I salute those who won the vaccine battle in laboratories and those who, risking their own health and lives, vaccinated hundreds of millions of the co-habitants of our planet! But was the access to vaccines fair? Did we not forget that in a pandemic situation a vaccine is more of a human right than a commodity regulated by market principles?  I wanted Poland to be, right from the start, a country of solidarity, a country not guided by the rule: the weaker has to die. Therefore, we tried to protect each and every life with the same  commitment.  Therefore,  whenever  we  could,  we  tried  to  show  solidarity  with  other nations  who  needed  assistance  at  a  given  time.  I  am  not  able  to  say  whether  we  did everything  possible  but  still  we  tried  for  instance  by  sending  our  medical  doctors  to  our friends in Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan as well as the USA and Italy.  I am convinced that some of the countries of the rich North behaved in the same way as Poland, who donated  million doses of vaccines to inter alia our partners from the South. But was that enough to close the obvious gap in the access to vaccines which got wasted in some states and were inaccessible in others? It seems to me that our part of humanity still has many reasons to be dissatisfied with itself.   Ladies and Gentlemen, Honorable Delegates,  The word ""solidarity"" does not refer exclusively to the pandemic, whereas the pandemic did not make other global problems disappear.    We are discussing the rights of nations in this forum. Let me ask you then: what is the first right  of  every  nation?  It  is  the  right  to  self-determination  and  the  right  to  democratic governance  set  out  in  detail  in  the  science  of  democratization  and  enshrined  in  the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights adopted by the UN. I am absolutely sure that most of us agree on the fact that each of our nations, the United Nations, has to right to protect its borders, to their inviolability, to choose its system of government and to govern with the consent of the nation, and never against it.   Ladies and Gentlemen, do we really agree with that? Since  I  have  an  impression,  and  it  is  not  only  my  impression,  that  Covid-  allowed  us  to easily  forget  about  multiple  misfortunes  plaguing  different parts  of  our globe,  often  in the vicinity of our homes.   During the pandemic reports of the tragedy in Syria, where an externally supported civil war has  inflicted  unimaginable  suffering  on  the  population  and  turned  millions  of  people  into refugees and fugitives, vanished from the headlines.    The tragedy in Libya is barely noticed by many people from the rich North. During Covid- we did not move any closer to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which requires a two-state, peaceful solution.  Unfortunately, tragic developments are unfolding also close to the Polish border and I have the impression that humanity seems to have forgotten about them.  Furthermore,  the  pandemic  has  not  stopped  the  war  in  Ukraine  where  over    thousand people died since the beginning of the Russian aggression with one state seizing the territory of another.  What was the response of the rich North to the drama of the Ukrainian nation fighting for its independence?  The  response  was  the  construction  of  a  large  Nord  Stream    gas  pipeline which  will  carry  Russian  gas  to  Western  Europe  bringing  further  billions  in  revenue  to  the aggressor and complete helplessness or even indifference to the fact that from that moment on Ukraine will find itself in an even bigger danger.  Recently  I  have  attended  the  Crimea  Platform  Summit  in  Kiev  being  one  of  few  leaders representing  the  rich  North.  I  searched  with  my  eyes  for  those  who  have  constructed  and approved the construction of Nord Stream . I did not find them.    Covid-  also  obscures  to  many  people  the  events  in  neighboring  Belarus,  where  since August  2020  hundreds  of  thousands  of  people  have  come  out  daily  for  peaceful  protests demanding  just  one  thing:  respect  for  the  election  result.  In  response  they  encountered police batons, tear gas and, often times, bullets used by the regime to defend itself against its own people.    As  I  speak  more  than  650  persons  are  in  prisons  in  Belarus,  the  majority  of  them  young women  and  men,  patriots,  who  simply  wanted  to  choose  their  leader  in  fair  elections.  A kangaroo court has lately sentenced two of them – Marya Kalesnikava and Maxim Znak - to  and  years in prison respectively. Along with them the leaders of the Polish minority in Belarus – Andżelika Borys and Andrzej Poczobut – are either detained or imprisoned for their democratic activity. These are just a few names from among hundreds of those persecuted. We demand their release and expect greater solidarity from the international community.   What have these people done that was so wrong? Nothing. They wanted to claim the same right to elect their government that the French, the Poles, the Americans, the Koreans, the Australians, or the people of Argentina have. The wanted the free elections, in which many of  us  run,  the  Presidents  of  the  free  world  and  the  importance  of  which  the  UN  General Assembly  so  emphatically  expressed  in  a  series  of  historic  resolutions:  “Enhancing  the effectiveness of the principle of periodic and genuine elections”. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, they paved the way for the realization that the right to form one's own government is not some Western whim but a universal human right. I am saying all of this as a leader of a country where almost 150 thousand Belarusians have found  shelter  and  employment,  including thousands  of protesters.  I have  recently  told  our Belarusian brothers  that  they  are welcome here  and that Poland will be  their  home for  as long as they deem it appropriate and necessary.   But solidarity comes at a price. Because regimes tend to defend themselves not only against their own citizens but also against democratic states. in  Belarus  has  taken  the  shape  of  an The  response  of  the  authoritarian  regime unprecedented  hybrid  attack  on  the  borders  of  Poland,  Latvia,  and  Lithuania,  the  three countries  on  the  eastern  flank  of  NATO  and  the  European  Union.  For  many  weeks,  the regime  of  Alexander  Lukashenko  has  been  bringing  tens  of  thousands  of  desperate inhabitants of the Middle East into its country, forcing them under police batons to cross our borders in an attempt to create an artificial ""humanitarian crisis."" These people then camp out at the border, and the regime is deaf to our offers to provide them with humanitarian aid. The regime treats these people: the immigrants as pawns in a political game, and their dignity and fundamental rights are offended.    In  this  crisis,  we  will  not  succumb  because  on  our  part,  there  is  no  agreement  to instrumental treatment of migrants, no agreement to the abuse of their vulnerable situation pitched against the security of our borders. I am saying this also as a leader of a country that knows very well how to tell the difference between  a  humanitarian  crisis  and  hybrid  activities;  the  country  which,  together  with  its allies,  participated  in  the  refugee  rescue  operation  in  Kabul  airport  just  a  few  weeks  ago. Initially,  our  intention  was  to  evacuate  dozens  of  military  and  diplomatic  staff  who cooperated with us. We ended up evacuating over one thousand people. We helped other countries  to  exfil  their  own  people,  but  we  also  benefited  from  the  solidarity  shown  by others, particularly by the Republic of Uzbekistan.   I am saying this to remind you once again that the world did not come to a standstill during the pandemic. The pandemic has not deprived nations of their democratic aspirations, nor has it stifled people's desire to live in freedom. Nor has it suppressed the craving for dignity and respect across large swathes of the globe. I recently saw myself the enthusiasm among the Moldovan voters, who took power away from the oligarchs plundering the country and voted in favor of reforms, democracy, and normality. I assured them of Poland's support for any initiative of the kind in our region, wherever we have influence. Because these are moments that restore faith in the most fundamental values of humanity and inspire the spirit of profound solidarity in other countries, my own included. Ladies and Gentlemen, Esteemed Delegates, Dear Friends, Trivial as it may sound, we all realize that the mankind is not homogeneous and each of us has  his  or  her  own  world  of  values,  beliefs,  and  things  that  are  sacrosanct  to  us.  But  the experience of sharing the same planet and the knowledge that we have no other, teach us coexistence and prompt us to define the framework thereof.   International  law  is  such  a  framework:  it  is  one  of  the  greatest  achievements  of  modern times. We can debate at length about reforming the UN system, but each of such debates comes down to one thing: how to promote the United Nations’ role in securing the primacy of international law. Because we want to live in a world founded on law, not on force. Securing  respect  for  international  law  was  one  of  Poland's  priorities  as  a  member  of  the Security  Council  in  2018-2019.  Today  we  continue  in  the  same  vein,  in  support  of international law, by serving in the Human Rights Council.  Our  priority  is  to  protect  vulnerable  groups:  civilians  in  armed  conflicts  or  religious minorities. The  same  purpose  will  be  pursued  by  the  Polish  chairpersonship    of  the  Organization  for Security and Co-operation in Europe in 2022, where we want to work for the resolution of   regional and  frozen  conflicts.  We  want  to  tap  OSCE  potential to  improve  the  conditions of the weakest and most vulnerable people. We will also strive to make human rights the main point  of  reference  for  OSCE  activities,  perceiving  that  solidarity  is  the  fundamental  value underlying human rights, the rights enjoyed by every human being. Dear Delegates, Esteemed Fellow Leaders of the World, The pandemic has nearly removed from the headlines another major topic - the fight against climate change, the fight for a secure future for all of us and for our children. We,  the  leaders,  must  realize  what  it  takes  to  protect  people  and  the  planet  from  climate change.  This  problem  will  not  disappear  together  with  the  pandemic.  It  is  also  part  of international solidarity.  Let me pose this question once again: do we, the rich North, pass the test of solidarity, or do we merely cater to our own statistics by relocating production to the poorer countries of the South where least environment friendly technologies are applied. And then those countries are blamed for contaminating the planet. I am saying this as a leader of a country that overthrew the communist dictatorship in 1989 and inherited a very difficult ecological situation in the aftermath. Over the last thirty years we have made tremendous progress on that count. Between 1988 and 2016 Poland reduced its carbon dioxide emissions by more than %, our rivers and air have become cleaner and the country greener. Moreover, being a country of primeval forests, woods, great lakes and rivers, every year Poland attracts many lovers of nature from all over Europe. I could also add that the share of hard coal in our energy mix is systematically decreasing, with biofuels and renewable energy sources gaining ground, but at this point, let me humbly admit that this is only the beginning of the road.  Indeed, during our presidency of COP24 we managed to finalize negotiations of the Katowice Rulebook, an agreement that streamlines the implementation of the Paris Agreement so as to  make  it  transparent  and  fair  to  all  parties.  It  is  also  fair  to  say  that  we  supported  the transformation of our energy sector with due respect to the socio-economic context. But at the same time, we realize that more effort will be needed. Therefore, in February this year, the Polish government gave a seal of approval to the ""Energy Policy of Poland until 2040"", which maps out the directions of energy transformation. The document is an important step towards low- and zero-emission transition in Polish economy. It is my firm belief that in the name  of  solidarity  the  strategy  will  be  further  implemented  by  the  government  of  my successor-in-office. Honorable Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen,   Solidarity  has  not  ceased  to  exist  in  the  face  of  a  pandemic.  It  should  continue  to  be  our motto and our central tenet together with others, not to compromise on human rights and the rights of entire nations, to secure the development of the UN, always in due respect of the primacy of international law, and to be ready  to set and pursue ambitious goals in the struggle for our planet. In  the  last    months  when  the  pandemic  weighed  so  heavily  on  us,  we  have  often  asked ourselves: what will the post-pandemic world be like? Will it be the world of solidarity? Or shall we resume business as usual and consider that these months have been nothing more than an interruption in our routine, after which we can go on repeating our old mistakes? Personally, I believe that the mankind shares the same aspirations: security and prosperity, democracy  and  human  rights,  a  world  without  wars  and  violations  of  borders,  nations respecting each other's territories, languages and identities, a world without discrimination, without offence of inherent dignity of human beings, a world that consistently endorses the principles    invoked  by  the  authors  of  the  Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights.  A  world based on solidarity. I believe that Poland will be striving for such a world, no matter who holds the office of its president.  Thank you for your attention!      "
76,2021,MDA,Republic of Moldova,"President of theRepublic of Moldova, delivered at the 76thSession of the United Nations’ General AssemblyNew York,  September 2021Dear President of the United Nations General Assembly, Dear Secretary-General of the United Nations,Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen,A few weeks ago, my country, the Republic of Moldova, celebrated the -th anniversary ofits independence. I want to use this opportunity to once again congratulate my fellowcitizens on this important milestone for us! Together, we chose democracy and freedomover corruption and state capture. It is my great honor to address today this high-level UNforum on their behalf.Some voices claim that multilateralism is no longer relevant in this day and age. That wecannot work together efficiently any longer at countering global challenges because we aretoo much inward looking as a result of our own overwhelming domestic problems. Ourworld today, however, faces extraordinary challenges, both in magnitude and in kind. These,I claim, can only be solved together.Most of today’s global challenges spill over national borders as our world is moreinterconnected than ever before. The Covid- pandemic, climate change, growinginternational security challenges, and the fragility of international rules-based order, allrequire joint work in search for sustainable solutions. These problems cannot be solvedalone. We require genuine, concerted international efforts to provide truly sustainablesolutions for our future.My country experiences some of these challenges first-hand. And I stand before you todayto convey our willingness and readiness to work with the UN institutions and theinternational community to find sustainable solutions to these challenges that affect usboth collectively and individually.Let me go through these four challenges separately.First, there is no doubt that the Covid- pandemic has been the biggest challenge of ourgeneration so far. Like most other states, the Republic of Moldova has been hit hard. But ourown experience of dealing with the crisis has been filled with hope and gratitude. Gratitudefor the tremendous global endeavor of solidarity that supported my country’s work tocontain the virus. And hope - that solidarity can make us all more resilient.Thanks to our external partners, my fellow citizens could start vaccination already inMarch. We now have a sufficient supply of vaccines for our citizens. Our healthcare systemreceived important international support. I’d like to take this opportunity to thank the  European Union and its member states, the World Health Organization,  and the entire UNfamily, and all our friends and partners for their continuous help to fight this pandemicworldwide. As more countries get access to vaccines, our greatest task ahead is to promoteimmunization, relaunch our economies and reopen our societies. This can only be achievedthrough collective effort.Second, climate change – another major challenge we are all faced with. We live through itsconsequences as we speak - extreme weather, record-high temperatures, floods affectingevery country.For the Republic of Moldova, climate change means severe droughts every few years, floods,ruined crops and livelihoods of people.The footprint of the Republic of Moldova for climate change has been low, and we arecommitted to keeping it this way. As we seek to modernize our economy, we pledge to do soin a sustainable way. Expanding our forests, transitioning to a green and circular economy,promoting clean energy, preserving water and land resources, promoting responsible andsustainable production and consumption is our way forward. Third, international security. We see more and more security crises arising in differentparts of our planet. In an interdependent world, their aftershocks can be felt across theglobe. When referring to our region, we are seriously concerned with the deterioratingsecurity situation in the Black Sea area.Here I would like to stress once again that the Republic of Moldova is a state committed topeace. We remain firmly committed to identifying a peaceful, political solution to theconflict in the Transnistrian region of our country, based on Moldova’s sovereignty andterritorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders. We will also continuepromoting confidence-building measures with a strong emphasis on protectingfundamental rights and freedoms in the Transnistrian region – a pressing issue for mycountry.In the spirit of Moldova’s Constitutional neutrality and international law, I would also like toreiterate that our position on the complete and unconditional withdrawal of Russian forcesremains unchanged. This includes the removal or destruction of ammunitions from theCobasna stockpiles which pose a security and environmental threat to the region as awhole. We count on the support of the international community in this endeavor.Erosion of democracy and the declining trust in the state that it produces is anotherimportant global challenge I would like to address. This is particularly relevant for mycountry. Democracy remains our universal ideal and a core value for our state. Rebuildingcitizens’ trust in public institutions, cleaning up the state from vested interests anddelivering decent public services is the cornerstone of Moldova’s further democraticprogress and modernization. Democracy is threatened by several factors. One of them is the spread of disinformation.While new social media platforms have been an important tool to mobilize and spreaddemocratic practices in many regions of the world, they are also enhancing disinformation,which, in worst case scenarios, may seriously disrupt key democratic processes such aselections. We need a global conversation and to jointly look for concrete solutions to thedangers that disinformation poses to the rules-based international order. Another factor that erodes democracy is corruption. Corruption undermines people’s trustin their states. While no country is exempt from it, corruption disproportionately affectspoor states. It makes the state and its institutions weaker, more vulnerable, and less stable.In the recent past, corruption transformed Moldova into a captured state. Corruptionbecame a threat to democracy and to our national security. Crooks used us as a transitcountry to launder money through our institutions before depositing them abroad. We havemanaged to overthrow these corrupt regimes, and now, our main task is to strengthen ourjustice and law enforcement systems. We are committed to doing so, but fixing one end ofthe problem does not make the problem disappear.  A system, in which criminals extract wealth and assets from countries with weakinstitutions, store this capital in offshores, and then find safe haven in other countries, isboth unsustainable and unfair. Designing international rules for asset recovery could bringmore fairness to the global stage and do justice to weaker states.As an international community, we need to design, apply, and rigorously monitor systems topromote international transparency and accountability. We need to join efforts to combatmoney-laundering and investigate illicit financial flows. We need to make better use ofasset seizure tools and to work together to suppress organized crime. The magnitude of thechallenge is so extensive that we need the serious involvement of all international andnational actors. We need an effective collective response to safeguard democracy and theinternational rules-based order.Mr. President, Mr. Secretary General,Together we can propose better and more sustainable solutions to global challenges. Theseshould be, first and foremost, citizen-oriented. In last year’s elections, the citizens ofMoldova clearly said that our country can do better. Despite multiple setbacks, peoplecontinued to fight tirelessly for our young democracy, for our European future.With a strong mandate for change, we are beginning to clean up the state from corruption.We are reforming the justice sector. We are launching a significant infrastructure build-up.We are working on connecting Moldova to the rest of Europe through bridges, improvedrailways, electricity and gas interconnectors. We are part of free trade areas both with theEU and our neighbors to the East. We can provide excellent business opportunities to both.We have a highly-educated, and hard-working population. We are becoming a good placefor investment. We have ambitious plans for digitalization of the economy and the publicsector. Protecting the environment is a central part of our reform process. Only a year ago,these were just hopes. Today, we are turning these hopes into reality.Distinguished audience,We come from different parts of the world and we have different national agendas, but ourlives are interlinked. The global challenges I referred to bring us closer than ever. Theircomplexity can only be overcome through collective efforts in search for sustainablesolutions. Such solutions are easier to find in today’s world, because we have at ourdisposal not only great minds but also the necessary tools.  We salute the UN Secretary General's Report on ""Our Common Agenda"" as aforward-looking blueprint for an enhanced global cooperation to effectively address thecommon challenges.Only through solidarity and closer international cooperation will we, UN Member States, beable to overcome current and emerging challenges and reach the vision for a world wherepeople live in peace and prosperity, in harmony with nature.Thank you. "
77,2021,ROU,Romania,"President of Romania, Mr. Klaus Iohannis, at the high-level segment of the 76th session of the General Assembly of the United Nations Organisation Mr. President of the General Assembly,  Mr. Secretary General,  Excellencies,  Ladies and gentlemen,  This  is  our  second  general  debate  during  the  COVID-  pandemic,  which  has fundamentally changed our way of life.  While  the  pandemic  affected  almost  all  aspects  of  our  lives,  it  also  provided  us  with opportunities to learn, adapt and do things better.  Global  challenges  require  common  solutions,  solidarity  and  cooperation.  Romania strongly believes that democratic values and a rules-based international order, with the UN at its  core,  are  fundamental  to  build  a  safer  and  better  future.  An  effective  and  equitable multilateralism, directly benefiting our citizens, is essential. The pandemic also showed us that we need to find ways to build back better and greener. We must recommit to  achieving sustainable economies, as well as resilient, fair and inclusive societies where „no one is left behind”. Indeed, the special needs of the vulnerable ones should be granted particular attention.  In order to be effective in achieving this aim, solidarity in action is necessary.  We  also  need  an  integrated  and  innovative  approach  to  respond  simultaneously  to  a whole range of inter-related challenges, such as health, demographic changes, migration, scarce resources, climate change and biodiversity loss, extreme poverty and hunger. We are indeed at an “inflection point” and Romania welcomes the newly issued report on Our Common Agenda, supports its main conclusions and encourages the Secretary General to continue efforts towards their implementation. Romania  remains  committed  to  contribute  to  the  collective  efforts  meant  to  limit  and recover the delays in advancing the Sustainable Development Goals. Ladies and gentlemen, The  post-COVID  recovery  needs  to  place  sustainability  at  its  core  and  we  must  work together to protect our planet and ecosystems. The effects of climate change have no national borders and the responsibility to effectively address them rests on all of us.  Working with other States and international organizations to respond to climate change is a priority of my current mandate as President of Romania. 2021 should bring a leap forward in preventing climate change and protecting biodiversity.       Recently we have also witnessed the potential and the challenges of digital technologies. We  must  ensure  meaningful  and  safe  access  to  the  Internet,  strengthen  cybersecurity  and promote responsible behavior in the cyberspace, while addressing the digital spread of hatred and disinformation.  Bucharest  brings  its  contribution  by  hosting  the  European  Cybersecurity  Centre,  which will improve cyber-resilience and cybersecurity research across the European Union. The  pandemic  has  also  prompted  us  to  act  together  to  consolidate  our  national  health systems and make them more resilient. An urgent priority is to ensure equitable and affordable global access to vaccines and treatments for COVID-. Romania reaffirms its support for the COVAX  Facility  and  we  have  contributed  to  the  “Team  Europe”  approach  to  help  various countries  to  tackle  the  impact  of  the  pandemic.  Romania  fully  supports  the  adoption  of  an international legal instrument for pandemic preparedness and response.  Ladies and gentlemen, The  primary  responsibility  for  the  protection  and  promotion  of  human  rights  lies  with our States. We must all ensure that restrictions related to COVID- do not exacerbate rights violations.  Romania  remains  strongly  committed  to  the  promotion  and  protection  of  human  rights worldwide.  My  country  promotes  the  imperative  of  combating  discrimination  and  hate-speech, including anti-Semitism.  We  have  adopted  this  year  the  first  Romanian  National  Strategy  for  preventing  and combating  anti-Semitism, xenophobia, radicalisation and hate speech. Romania  will  continue  to  work  towards  these  objectives,  including  by  pursuing  a mandate to the Human Rights Council for the term 2023 – 2025. Ladies and gentlemen, The  COVID-  pandemic  has  made  humanitarian  intervention  even  more  difficult. Nevertheless, common international action to guarantee human security is needed, as no one is safe until everyone is safe.  Romania  has  included  the  refugees  and  persons  at  risk  in  the  national  public  health coverage.  We have provided them with access to all necessary medical facilities and immunization campaigns, including against COVID-.  Nowadays, we all look to Afghanistan and the most pressing issue is the safe passage for the Afghans who are willing to leave. We have recently welcomed vulnerable groups of Afghan citizens to Romania. Ensuring that human rights, especially the rights of women, children and minorities  are  respected  is  also  essential.  We  also  have  to  make  sure  that  humanitarian assistance can be delivered.  Ladies and gentlemen, As Presidency of the Community of Democracies, Romania will continue to work towards upholding all democratic principles.      We thus encourage all States to ensure the proper functioning of democratic institutions, uphold respect for the rule of law and guarantee the fundamental rights and freedoms.  Distinguished audience, Armed conflicts, ethnic divide and inequalities are still harsh realities. It is the right time to turn the COVID- crisis and its security impact into an opportunity to revitalize the peace and  security  agenda,  with  renewed  emphasis  on  conflict  prevention  and  the  consolidation  of peace processes.  The protracted conflicts in Romania’s vicinity continue to threaten Europe’s security.  Romania  supports  the  lasting  peaceful  resolution  of  these  conflicts,  through  political negotiations, in the framework of their dedicated formats.  Ladies and gentlemen, We must step up and confront the global threat of terrorism, by acting in a coordinated manner. Romania maintains its full commitment to preventing and combating terrorism at the international level, building upon the newly reviewed Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. The  concept  of  resilience  is  an  important  component  of  our  security,  as  well  as  a  key factor in protecting democracy.  For Romania, ensuring strategic resilience, both at state and society level, is a priority and this is highlighted by the Euro-Atlantic Center for Resilience which we created in Romania.  The  Center,  which  will  be  open  to  all  partner  countries,  is  meant  to  manage  various programs  and  to  advance  resilience,  be  it  societal  or  in  the  field  of  emerging  and  disruptive technologies, resilience of communication systems and technological ecosystems, resilience to complex crises and emergencies, ensuring the continuity of government and essential services and resilience of the transport infrastructure. Ladies and gentlemen, Romania  firmly  believes  in  the  potential  of  international  law  to  contribute  to international security.  We reaffirm our appreciation for the activity of the International Court of Justice.  Accepting  the  Court’s  jurisdiction  serves  the  cause  of  international  peace.  It  is  in  this spirit that Romania, together with a group of supporting States, is promoting a declaration on this topic and invites all interested delegations to endorse it and support this initiative.      Ladies and gentlemen, Last, but not least, let me remind us that an international organization is as strong as the political willingness of its member States to make it relevant and fit for the times we are living in. Let us all join efforts to achieve the United Nations’ noble goals!                                    Thank you!    "
78,2021,SVK,Slovakia,"President of Slovakia | September , 2021 Dear Mr President of the General Assembly,  Dear Mr Secretary General, Dear colleagues, Excellences,  Ladies and Gentlemen, That  at  least,  some  of  you  can  meet  in  person  after  two  complicated pandemic  years  fills  me  with  some  optimism.  Optimism  that  science  can  and  does  offer  solutions  –  and  that  if  we  respect  scientific recommendations, we will overcome the challenges ahead.   Indeed, we are in a much better place than a year ago. Vaccines offer a clear path  out  of  the  pandemic  –  but  where  the  scientists  have  succeeded  –  in  sequencing  the  virus  or  producing  safe  vaccines  –  the  politics  are  still failing. A year ago, we made promises and pooled resources. More than  billion vaccine  doses  have  been  administered  across  the  world  –  but  nearly  %  of  them  are  in  just  ten  countries.  Fifty  countries  have  less  than  a  %  vaccination  rate,  with  half  of  them  just  a  %  rate.  This  is  a  failure  of politics projected onto the world stage in real-time. Vaccine egoism will only  delay the pandemic’s  end and lend time to new more  lethal  mutations.  Solidarity  should  be  our  binding  principle,  not an option. Vaccines must be accessible to all and Slovakia will continue supporting the COVAX effort.  Even  as  we  get  close  to  defeating  Covid-,  let  us  not  rush  into  business  as  usual,  just  because  we  can.  Our  memory  of  how  things  were  must  be complemented by our reflection on whether they were right.  Secretary-General Guterres rightly said that we have our common agenda. Slovakia fully subscribes to the priorities laid out in this report.  Simply put, our common task is saving our planet. Previously, the Earth was whispering but now she is screaming that she cannot hold us any longer, that  humankind  is  too  heavy  a  burden  to  carry.  Saving  the  planet  is not a promise we make today for our successors to implement it later.           UN General Assembly | 76th Session | Address by the President of Slovakia | September , 2021 We  have  hesitated  for  so  long  that  we  have  run  out  of  generations  of political leaders who can talk the talk but do nothing. This task is upon  us today.   Saving  our  planet  means  accelerating  our  response  to  the  climate  crisis.  The findings of the recent IPCC report might be shocking. Yet, they are just stating  facts.  In  less  than  six  months,  we  were  able  to  strike  a  deal  on  global  fair  taxation.  We  must  equally  strike  a  deal  to  prevent  global carbon  leakage.  The  upcoming  COP26  in  Glasgow  must  set  the  pace  for a much swifter adaptation and radical emissions cuts.  Slovakia  will  reduce  our  emissions  by  %  by  2030  and  become  climate neutral by 2050, along with the rest of the European Union. By 2023, coal will no longer be used to produce electricity and heat. In the coming years, we  will  spend  almost  %  of  our  GDP  on  economic  recovery:  one-third  of that will go into our green transition.  None of this will be  easy. Per capita, Slovakia is the biggest car producer  in  the  world.  Clean  mobility,  locally  developed  and  produced  greener batteries  will  decarbonize in  Slovakia  and  elsewhere.  transport We are ready to share our solutions – and learn from the best.  We  must  decouple  economic  growth from the degradation we  have  been causing  to  the  planet  –  and  support  those  most  affected,  those  forced  out of  their  homes  by floods  or drought,  or those  losing jobs as  we  close down  the  most  polluting  factories.  The  Green  Climate  Fund  must  be properly funded and accessible.  At the Kunming summit, we must all play our part to protect biodiversity. In  Slovakia,  half  of  the  national  parks’  territory  will  be  free  of  human intervention by 2025. In  years, this will be three-quarters of our national parks.   Excellences, Unless we stop global warming, future generations will suffer. Our failure will damage multilateralism and spur violence.           UN General Assembly | 76th Session | Address by the President of Slovakia | September , 2021 Saving  our  planet,  therefore  also  means  upholding  a  rules-based international  order  and  the  rule  of  law,  at  home  and  abroad.  Violation  of  these  rules  endangers  everyone,  not  only  those  directly  affected  in Ukraine, Syria, Myanmar, or the Sahel region. It is the UN Security Council’s main responsibility to maintain international peace and security. Too often, we see it unable to act. Stopping violence and providing humanitarian access is not something to bargain about – it must be our utmost priority.  We  must  make  our  own  democracies  more  resilient  and  support  those demanding their basic rights – including the freedom of speech or assembly –  are  respected.  These  rights  are  not  a  menu  for  governments  to  choose from.  Citizens  must  exercise  them  freely:  in  Belarus  where  650  people  are  prosecuted  on  political  grounds,  such  as  the  social  scientist  Valeria Kostyugova – or in the occupied Crimea, or Venezuela, Russia, or Xinjiang.  Distinguished Assembly,  The  developments  and  lessons  learnt  from  Afghanistan  will  be  high  on our agenda, and rightly so. This reflection is necessary. But we must also urgently  provide  humanitarian  assistance  to  the  people  in  Afghanistan, % of whom are facing acute food insecurity.  Over the past two decades, girls and women in Afghanistan could exercise their legitimate  rights.  These  must  not  be  taken  away.  Together  with  the  Prime  Minister  of  Iceland,  the  Prime  Minister  of  New  Zealand,  and  other  women  political  leaders  we  launched  a  call  to  support  Afghan girls and women. I invite you to join forces to ensure this turns into concrete steps.  My final point is about inclusiveness. We cannot save our planet if we leave out  the  vulnerable  –  the  women,  the  girls,  the  minorities.  The  silent pandemic  of  gender-based  violence  can  prove  lethal  to  the  health  of  our  societies.  Our  long-term  strategies,  however  brilliant,  will  become short-lived history if we do not involve young people.          UN General Assembly | 76th Session | Address by the President of Slovakia | September , 2021 To conclude, let me recall the words Pope Francis addressed to our youth during his  recent visit to Slovakia: “Do not be  dismayed or yield to those who tell you that nothing will ever change.”  We can change the world around us for the better. Let us start now.  Thank you.     "
79,2021,UKR,Ukraine,"President of Ukraine,  at the general debate of the 76th session of the UN General Assembly ( September 2021)  Dear Mr. President! Dear heads of state and government! Ladies and gentlemen! It's time to wake up! This is the appeal of the UN Secretary-General, Mr. Guterres, to the world leaders, to you and me on the eve of the Assembly. For me, this call is special. For me, every night before the UN General Assembly is a sleepless night. In 2019, this was the excitement before the first speech. 2020 in general was a sleepless year for the world through COVID-. And about last night I will tell in more detail.  am. Dozens of calls. There was an attempt on the life of the first aide to the President of Ukraine.  shots. Three of them hit the driver. Here is the price of change in the state, here is the price of reforms. Fortunately, Serhiy is alive. Fortunately, nothing threatens the driver's life for now. But this speech of mine will be atypical for the UN. Although I believe - definitely useful for each of you. Is it time to wake up? I can say without flattery and cunning: Ukraine did it a long time ago, since then it has not fallen asleep. It did not fall asleep when it survived the Holodomor, Babyn Yar. Did not fall asleep when the whole world  survived  two  wars,  the  Holocaust,  lost  100  million  people.  This  was  the  price  for  humanity  to realize that all nations, all countries are equal, and all conflicts must be resolved through dialogues and only through dialogues, not tanks. Believing this, in 1945 Ukraine became one of the founding members of the United Nations. Today, they would be shocked to see the words ""ensure the rights of all peoples"" in the theme of the General Assembly. I'm sure they would say, ""What have you been doing all these  years?"" The answer was given by COVID-. We played equality, we played unity, where it's one thing to share common goals, and it's another to share vaccines together. Life-giving vaccines. It turned out that in articles about equality, as in advertising, there are stars and the inscription in small print: ""We are all people, we are all in the same boat, but lifeboats will first be given to the 1st class passengers."" Ukraine did not expect help from others. And helped others without waiting for gratitude. We sent our doctors to Italy, sent the necessary assets. Ukraine helped everyone who needed it at a time when the world had forgotten that the pandemic would not last forever, and that all nations would one day gather here again. But how will they look each other in the eyes now? Ukraine is not ashamed. It has the right to say: we want to revive the UN. To begin with, its Charter must be revived. These are not recommendations that can be followed at will. You will not find the words ""Every man for himself"" there. And then the world would not have to admit that it failed the test of COVID-, the test of unity. And  it  would  not  have  to  hide  face  on  the  20th  anniversary  of  the  UN  Durban  Declaration  on  the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. Who could have imagined that drugs would one day be an instrument of discrimination? In the context of constant conversations about the global food crisis, it is interesting: will we ever share bread and water in the same way?! Are we waking up? I want to believe that.     Because  COVID-  was  not  completely  overcome.  And  the  global  vaccination  plan  has  not  gone anywhere. Plus, the guarantees that there will  be no new viruses in the world are as ""strong"" as the security guarantees of the Budapest Memorandum. Is it time to wake up? Honestly - Ukraine did not fall asleep. It is difficult to do so due to the sounds of explosions, the sounds of shots being heard in our occupied Donbas for the eighth year in a row. In 2019, I said from this rostrum: the war in Ukraine is more than  thousand dead.  thousand wounded. Imagine: one and a half million people are forced to leave their homes. Every year these figures are heard in the UN with only one amendment - every year, unfortunately, these figures are growing. I talked about this in 2020. And I'm talking about it now, in 2021. And this is almost  thousand people killed already. And even more wounded. And even more homeless people. Here is the price of freedom, here is the price of independence. Probably  shots  are  not  heard  as  loudly  in  Central  Park  or  Madison  Square  Garden  as  in  Avdiivka industrial zone or Svitlodarsk Arc. Do we want to revive the UN? Perhaps the UN should move for this? Be mobile and fast? Perhaps it's time for us to meet where we can really hear and see these global problems? There are thousands of trouble spots throughout the world. Ukraine is ready to participate in UN meetings alongside any of them. In my opinion, the truth is needed to revive the UN. If  all  those  in  power  had  sincerely  supported the  peace-loving  efforts  of the  world  community,  shells would not have exploded on Afghan land today, and machine guns would not have terrorized the civilian population. These are the words of Leonid Kravchuk, the first President of independent Ukraine, said  years ago at the 46th UN General Assembly.  years were not enough for humanity for these words to lose their relevance. One day was enough for Ukraine to start an operation to rescue civilians in Kabul. Our military evacuated almost 700 people. These are citizens of Ukraine, as well as citizens of many other, different countries, members of human rights organizations, journalists of various media: Global Mail, The Wall Street Journal, USA Today, Stars and Stripes. They were men, women, children, elderly people from different countries, of different nationalities, of different religions. This, I believe, is a commitment to the basic principles of the United Nations. The participation of  states and international organizations in the first Summit of the Crimea Platform on the de-occupation of Crimea is a commitment to the core principles of the United Nations. And I am very grateful to each of these countries. And  the  fact  that  the  UN  has  ignored  the  platform  for  solving  the  problems  of  international  law  and occupation is some new, unapproved principles. If we want to revive the UN, let us remember that there are no chosen ones here who cannot be offended. The UN is all of us, it's 193 countries. And I invite all these countries to join the joint declaration of the participants of the Crimea Platform, condemning  the  occupation  and  showing  that  you  are  against  the  forceful  change  of  borders  in  the world. This is not irony or trolling, but this format will always be open to Russia. And I'm ready to explain why. Because no one in the world feels safe anymore. I emphasize: no one feels safe. And no one can hide behind international law like behind a stone wall. This can lead to the collapse of the entire architecture of international relations. Then we really won't have any rules, except for the right of the strong. It will be a world in which, instead of collective work, selfishness will dominate, a world in which there will be more and more dictatorship, and less and less equality, less real democracy and freedom. After  all,  what  is  state sovereignty? First  of  all,  it  is  a question of  freedom, free choice of  one's own destiny for each person, for the people, for the state. All I have said now in Russian is the words of Russian President Vladimir Putin said in Munich in 2007 and at the UN General Assembly in 2015. Were they untrue? Unfortunately, we know Moscow's answer. In early September this year, Nariman Dzhelyalov, the first deputy chairman of the Crimean Tatar People's Mejlis, was illegally detained in Crimea. Russia accuses this political scientist, prominent journalist, TV presenter, teacher of law and history of trying to blow up a section of the gas pipeline. Here is the price of freedom, here is the price of fighting for your rights, for human rights. I really count on the support of the international community in the issue of his release and the release of about 450 Ukrainians illegally detained in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine and in the Russian Federation. I urge you to support the updated resolutions on the human rights situation in the occupied Crimea and the militarization of our Ukrainian occupied peninsula, which will be submitted to the General Assembly by the end of the year. We are grateful that the item on the ""Situation in the Temporarily Occupied Territories of Ukraine"" was included in the agenda of this Assembly. Although how, remaining occupied, Crimea and Donbas can disappear from the agenda?! This is obvious not only to us. I thank all the states that mentioned Ukraine in their speeches here this year. It is very important. And many others who are not ashamed that Ukraine is their friend and partner. Who can a spade a spade: call occupation occupation, and call aggression aggression, without fear that someone will leave this hall for everyone to see. It is not necessary to do this, it is a platform for dialogue. It will definitely not bring happiness to Ukraine. It could bring happiness to Ukraine if someone left our state territories, our state borders for everyone to see. In 1945, the Yalta Conference was held in Crimea, where new foundations of the world order were laid and it was decided to hold the first Conference on the Establishment of the United Nations. Both Yalta and Crimea have been occupied for eight years now. How do we want to revive the UN if the place where the idea of the UN emerged has been occupied by a permanent member of the UN Security Council? Mr. President of the 76th Assembly spoke a lot about climate change and the protection of the environment and nature on the planet. In this context, Crimea needs even more UN’s attention. They made a military base out of unique nature. Instead of fauna and flora there is a fleet and soldiers. And in the souls of the Crimean people, there is a problem opposite to the world - not global warming, but global devastation. We should admit, the world does not have enough time to sort all problems out. The UN raises very important issues and does not have time to solve them, because new important topics are emerging. Every time we seem to choose a ""global disaster of the year"". Which in a year few people will remember, because there will be a new one. Every Assembly the world puts them in a large backpack of threat, which it has been bearing for years and which is already overfilled. If we look even deeper  - there is famine, poverty, literacy, drinking water, clean air, occupation in it. We don't have enough time to solve this. And most importantly - we lack the courage. Because we act not as leaders, but as politicians. Who are simply afraid that someday humanity will call them to answer. And they leave a way out - we did not promise you anything. We did not promise to overcome famine. We said that we would make every effort to overcome it. We did not promise to overcome climate change. We promised to intensify our cooperation to overcome climate change. How much time, paper, energy have we spent on these ""we  are  determined"",  ""we  have  confirmed  a  common  interest  in  overcoming"",  ""we  have  agreed  to significantly strengthen cooperation""? We want to revive the UN? Let's talk to each other simply, let's speak  clearly,  concretely,  and  most  importantly  -  honestly,  frankly.  Then  we  will  stop  calling  the  UN General Assembly a ""debate."" This is not a debate. Because debate is a lively dialogue. This is an active dispute between  different  parties.  This  is  an  opportunity  to  ask  direct,  frank questions.  For  example, issuing hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians in the occupied territory of Ukraine hundreds of thousands of passports of another state. Isn’t it evidence of an international crime? Isn't it proof of impunity and disrespect  for  international  law?  Moreover,  the  Russian  Federation  itself  officially  declares  it.  And  it forces our citizens of Ukraine to take part in the elections to the Russian parliament. And if the UN does not react efficiently and strongly to this... Isn’t it proof that it is too late to revive the UN? But  I  believe  it  is  not.  And  the  UN  must  support  those  who  want  to  change  the  world  for  the  better. Today, Ukraine is presenting a number of initiatives, platforms and summits. Let's take only one - the Crimea Platform. It must work under the auspices of the United Nations. If every nation has such an effective platform, approved by the UN, which solves problems and works /, that means reviving the UN. Because it means to revive faith in the UN among ordinary people. Ladies and Gentlemen! I understand that criticism of the UN is often heard. But we criticize ourselves. The UN is not a building, the UN is the leaders. And it was they who created the UN  years ago. Could they have predicted and anticipated everything? I'm sure not. Could they have imagined that the veto mechanism as a symbol that ""one can be right for all"" would become a tool when one could blackmail everyone. No. Does this mean that everything is lost? I'm sure not. We, and therefore the UN, just need to believe in ourselves again. The UN has long heard only criticism. The accusation that the UN can do nothing. And the worst accusation is that ""the UN has become a League of Nations."" And today the UN is like a retired superhero who has forgotten what he could do. He considers himself a  burden,  a  weak,  frail,  useless  old  man,  whose  life  was  in  vain.  Or  maybe  the  UN  will  remember something? How has more than a billion people accessed drinking water for the first time since 1981? Who explained to the wild world that everyone has rights? And that they need to be protected. Who gave the first document, where they are described in detail? Who provides food to  million people in  countries? Thanks to whom did the shame called apartheid disappear from the planet? Whose ""blue helmets"" have maintained and continue to maintain peace in dozens of countries? Who created  UNESCO,  which  protects  the  Vatican,  Versailles,  the  Acropolis  and  a  total  of  1154  unique cultural  heritage  sites?  Who  created  UNICEF,  which  protects  children  in  more  than  190  countries? Children are the most important for us. Therefore, the call to unite for them cannot be banal or outdated. Unite for the sake of children. The most important thing we have. What do you say, Your Excellencies, Distinguished Heads of State and Government? Let's show that we are determined to make every effort to strengthen our interaction! And let’s just do it. Even without resolutions, declarations, coordination of positions. Just do it. As people. As nations. As united nations! As those who made their choice. Their actions will either be filled with substance or these chairs will be empty. Here is the price of this choice! Thank you!  "
80,2021,DNK,Denmark,"President. Dear delegates.  No one can be in doubt. We live in a connected world.  We face global challenges. They can only be solved if we work together. Covid-.  Human rights violations. Climate change. Poverty on the rise. Conflicts. As a founding member of the UN, Denmark is a strong voice for common solutions.  And today, we need global cooperation more than ever. * * * Throughout history, international solidarity has moved us forward.         It has the power to do so again.  Out of the pandemic. We must ensure global access to vaccines. None of us can leave COVID behind until all of us can.  Denmark is committed to vaccine solidarity and COVAX.  In the spring, we announced the donation of  million vaccine doses.  This week, we announce a re-doubling of our efforts.  We now aim to donate more than  million doses. That is more than one donated vaccine for each Dane.             It comes in addition to our commitment to COVAX with more than  million dollars.  If we are to battle this pandemic. We have to strengthen our ability to prevent and respond to future pandemics.  *** International solidarity also has the power to prevent a climate disaster.  The latest I-P-C-C report makes it clear that we are standing at a global crossroad.  We must continue our path towards a green future. And we must do it faster. We need to keep the Paris Agreement goal alive. Limiting the global temperature rise to . degrees.  Climate change hits the world’s poorest and weakest communities hardest.         Denmark will respond to the call of the Secretary-General. And massively scale up Danish grant-based climate finance to at least 500 million USD a year by 2023.  And we are dedicating  percent to adaptation in poor and vulnerable countries.  In addition, we are strengthening our efforts to mobilize public and private finance from other sources.  In total, Denmark aims to contribute at least  percent of the collective target of 100 billion dollars.  At the same time, we are fully focused on reducing our own emissions.  Denmark will be climate neutral no later than 2050.  And by 2030, we have committed to cut our greenhouse gas emissions by  percent. We have decided to end production of oil        and gas. And build the world’s first energy islands. In time, they will create clean energy for millions of European households. We call on you all to follow. And to do so urgently.  Every one of us need to act and adapt individually. But we also have to act for the common good.  * * * That is the case in Afghanistan as well.  The current situation is disturbing. For the long-suffering people of Afghanistan. For the women and children. And for the international community. We need a strong and coordinated response. The contribution at the international donor conference last week was an important step.        I would like to express my appreciation for the commitment of our international humanitarian partners. They are providing life-saving assistance. In Afghanistan. And in the many other places.  Peace missions are keeping peace, preventing conflicts and paving the way for progress every day around the world.  No people in conflict zones should be forgotten.  We must include those that have been excluded. And empower those that have been powerless.  Women and young people have a vital role to play. In peacebuilding and conflict prevention. Denmark remains committed to the agenda for Women, Peace and Security.  * * * International solidarity has the power to give us hope. Hope for a better future in the places we call home. Hope for protection when we need it.        But for many around the world, this hope comes at a high price. We are leaving the destiny of too many people to human smugglers.  The current asylum and migration system does not address the challenges we face today. We need to do better. To save lives. To prevent rape and abuse. It calls for new common solutions. My government is devoted to addressing the root causes.  We have dedicated a large amount of funding to regions of conflict. To help create conditions for a better future where people live. To help more people. We need to work together to ensure safe and orderly migration. And to protect those in need.          * * * Denmark is committed to a strong and efficient UN. That protects the rule-based international order, promotes a more progressive world, and fights injustice. Last year, we asked the Secretary-General to report back to us – the Member States – with recommendations to advance Our Common Agenda. He has done so. Now we have to act on these recommendations.  All of us. The Social Contract between governments and people should be renewed. In our own societies. And at the global level.  As host of the Social Summit in 1995, Denmark feels a special responsibility. So that we may gather again in 2025 and continue the work towards the S-D-G’s.  years on from Copenhagen and on the road to 2030.  Thank you.       "
81,2021,EST,Estonia,"President of the Republic of Estonia Kersti Kaljulaid at the 76th United Nations General Assembly ..2021 Mr President (of the General Assembly) Mr Secretary General, Your Excellences, Ladies and Gentlemen, Sisters and brothers, I am so sorry we  have not been able to meet  each  other for so long. I feel especially sorry that the conversations we started with many of you on  digital  development  and  digital  in  development  have  been discontinued. Yes, brainstormings, hackathons and similar events have continued online, delivering, in particular, fresh ideas at lightning speed on how to best overcome or circumvent the circumstances  we were all suddenly thrown in.  I am  proud how we  have rushed online globally, to reach out to each other,  to  provide  education  support,  to  develop  e-court  services,  to        deliver as much as we could, contactless. My special greetings go to the Chief Prosecutor of Kenya, who has made sure that Kenyan people can turn to the courts and receive verdicts while unable to travel, unable to meet.  Kenya  is not turning back,  because  even  when travel  would be safe  again,  why should someone  take a trip of hundreds of kilometres to be heard? This is an encouraging example. Through the tears we have shed for our lost  ones,  from  the  despair  and  devastation,  solutions  have  sprung which will enable us to become better, more egalitarian societies. I hope all governments who have seen the benefits of online service provision will  continue down  this  avenue.  This  helps  people  from  rural  areas, women  with  small  children  unable  to  go  and  queue  at  government offices, people with special needs, access better what societies can offer them. There  is  another  positive  takeaway  from  the  pandemic  –  if  we  truly globally concentrate  our financial  and scientific  efforts on a  problem, we  can  overcome.  But  only  if  we  really  feel  the  urgency.  I  feel encouraged  for  the  fight  against  climate  change  –  it  is  at  least  as dangerous  to  human  race  as  a  pandemic  is.  This  urgency  is  widely accepted.  We can  overcome,  some  day  – the day will come  when we will be  able  to look back,  as  humankind, and  find we  have  made  the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere to descend.      It  will  not be  the  day  when  we  see  planet  Earth  calming  down.  The unexpected storms,  heatwaves  in otherwise moderate  places and snow in regions which are not used to its cold bite, will continue even when we have stopped the trend of rising emissions. But it will be the day we give back hope to our children. Because  from that point onwards they can hope that the planet will slowly get better again.   If we can take these – more supportive governments towards the weaker in the societies  and potential to use the same  fervency we all together had to find vaccines now to stop climate change – the future generations will recognise this decade of this century as the Great Recovery. If we fail, it will be marked as the Beginning of an End.  I hope it is the first, but even if it is, there are many urgent problems we need to concentrate our minds on also, while we keep the big picture in our minds.  Last  Saturday,  people  in  more  than  160  countries  across  the  globe united to clean up the world. In last  years more than  million people across the world have joined the initiative.  World Clean-Up Day launched by Estonians in 2008 is by today one of the biggest  civic movements  of our time,  uniting about 160 countries across  the world for  a  cleaner  planet.  The simple  act  of cleaning  has become  a  force  that  binds  together  people  and  groups  that  would otherwise never dream of working towards the same goal. This is a great     example  of the grassroots  power of people, united by technology and the will to do something by themselves to save our planet. Our people can organise all by themselves  and do a lot by and for themselves,  but not all.  Conflicts  still  ravage  many  countries  and  new  ones  have  occurred.  Wars  continue  to  be  fought  from  Ukraine  to  Syria.  Authoritarian regimes like Belarus, for example, have come up with new hybrid tools to attack democratic  societies  with innocent people. Those who suffer the most continue to be the most vulnerable in our societies  – women, children and adolescents. When I visited  Afghanistan this April, I had the opportunity to meet women,  children  and  adolescents  who  had  grown  up in  a  society  of reconstruction  and  hope  towards  the  future.  The  women  worked  as midwives,  had the chance  to go to school and work, take care  of their own families and to assist others with their knowledge and experience. Today their future looks grim to say the least.  So does the situation in the whole country. The humanitarian needs there are enormous. About half of Afghanistan’s population, more than  million, is in the urgent need of humanitarian assistance,  including women and children.  As the UN Global Advocate for Every Woman Every Child, it makes me  sad  that  the  progress  seen  during  the  past  two  decades  in Afghanistan could be reverted so quickly.      While  despairing  for  Afghan  women’s  rights  to  participate  in  the society in any normal way, we must not forget that the opportunities for women and children globally have been hit hard by the pandemic. Even the most developed countries are not exempt.  The statistics  which concerns  women’s  participation in  the workforce or  their  proportion  among  the  unemployed,  the  number  of  women unable to reach ante- or postnatal care, the number of children deprived of  school  meals  –  is  the  silent  testimony,  a  dark  shadow  of  this pandemic. And things were not good even before the COVID hit – for example,  we were  not on track to reach our SDG goal of Zero Hunger by 2030.  The data gathered by H6 institutions with whom I cooperate as the UN Global  Advocate  predicts  we  will  have  to  rethink  many  of  our development strategies  in order to gain ground lost in pandemics  and then some. The  shadow  pandemic  of  starvation,  lack  of  access  to  education  or medical care – is going to continue at least until we manage to vaccinate the global population, and then it will take more time  still to turn the negative trends around. Estonia is contributing at least 900 000 doses of vacation – almost each grown-up  in  Estonia  who  takes  a  shot  donates  one  to  someone  else globally. Without vaccinating the global population, there is no way to even  start  the  recovery  from  the  shadow  pandemic.  We  all  are responsible for the future, and we all have to do our bit.      On September 17th Estonia (together with our Baltic friends Latvia and Lithuania) celebrated the  years anniversary of joining the UN. Thirty years is a little bit more  than one human generation. Today Estonia is an elected  member  of the United  Nations Security  Council. Over  the years, we have been not only security consumers, but also responsible contributors  in  different  regions  in  the  World  from  Sahel  to Afghanistan and Iraq.  In  March  2019,  as  the  president  of  the  4th  Session  of  the  UN Environment  Assembly  Estonia  led  the  adoption  of  a  ministerial declaration  whereby  countries  all  over  the  world  agreed  to  create  a global environmental data strategy for 2025.  The strategy  foresees the development of common  data  standards  and increasing  the quality of environmental data. It also aims to foster cross-border data sharing and interoperability, improve countries’ environmental  monitoring capacities and improve data analysis methods.  To support this process, Estonia is launching a global alliance, Data for the  Environment  Alliance  –  or  DEAL  for  short  –  that  would  bring together countries interested in improving the quality and accessibility of  environmental  data  and  developing  digital  solutions.  Since environmental  problems  are  crossing  national  borders,  we  should do away with all borders when using environmental data. The DEAL  will launch  during  the  5th  United  Nations  Environment  Assembly  in February 2022.       All countries can make a difference,  regardless of their size. In  the  19th century,  the  importance  of a  nation was  based  on natural resources  and territory. In the 20th century primarily on military  force. Today, the  main  resource  of countries  are  our  people.  People,  not as merely as tools of production, but as individuals with their rights and freedoms,  as  well  as  unbounded  imagination,  ingenuity  and entrepreneurship.  Only truly free people are creative enough to thrive in 21st century. Only democracies can give such freedom to people. That is why democracy,  human rights and the rights of the nations, are  the most important tools for peace and prosperity. Long-term  peace  and prosperity can only be born from the respect for basic rights. In Estonian minds, technological transformation cannot be separated from the respect from the basic rights and freedoms. The digital transformation and the integrated  data economy are one of the greatest  opportunities for our future  and makes  countries more efficient. This is particularly important for small countries with limited resources.  There is also another important aspect of the digitalisation we can never forget  - digital as an equaliser.  In order to prevent the emergence  of the digital inequality and division, last year Estonia and Singapore were co-sponsoring a Global Declaration on the Digital Response to COVID-, “Close the Digital Divides: the Digital Response to COVID-”.       Of course, the value we can extract from tools is contingent upon their utility—the manner in and the purpose for which those tools are  used. We must not help repressive states  become more efficient. Instead, we have to help those who are keen on using digital tools for the benefit of their citizens,  not to their detriment and oppression. It is important for Estonia that the basis of our cooperation are  shared values, principles, and interests—all  of which fundamentally hinge  on trust,  particularly trust created through digital means.  At the recent Tallinn Digital Summit we discussed how to utilise trust, transparency, and the free flow of data to make large-scale, cross-border infrastructure investments trustworthy.  Collective  concern  of governments and international organizations demonstrated the need for a  shared  framework to  underpin  our  cooperation  —  Trusted Connectivity.  This  framework  articulates  the  common  vocabulary, interest, values, principles, and standards necessary for us to safeguard democracy  and to  ensure  democratic  countries  respond to  the  global demand  for  physical  and  digital  infrastructure  by  offering  a  higher-quality, higher-standard alternative to those connectivity providers who do not share our love of free societies. Estonia  has  been  since  the  early  days  among  the  creators  of  the normative framework for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. At its heart is  international law,  including the UN Charter  in its entirety, international humanitarian law, human rights law. As the host nation of      the  independent  Tallinn  Manual,  which  is  starting  its  third  run,  we emphasise this wholeheartedly.   As an elected member of the Security Council, we were pleased to host the very first official discussion on cybersecurity in the Council earlier this year, which allowed us to raise awareness on threats to international peace and security stemming  from the malicious use of cyberspace and create  momentum  for the  implementation  of our existing  framework. Discussions on cybersecurity and cybercrime must ensure that we make a concentrated effort to implement the rules of the road we already have. We  cannot  go  down  this  road  without  bringing  companies  and  civil society along.  Legal  frameworks  have  utmost  importance,  but  laws  alone  do  not protect  us:  we  also  need  empathy,  democracy,  rule  of  law,  good governance and the flexibility to adopt changes  caused  inter alia by Covid-.  Countries  are  exporting  what  they  actually  are  and  what happens inside  their  own country. Countries  that repress  their people spread fear also to other countries and societies.  That is why we have to talk about the repressions  in Belarus, stand in solidarity  against  the  aggressive  and  destabilizing  behaviour  of Alyaksandr Lukashenkaʼs regime and remain convinced that the will of the  Belarusian  Nation  should be  the  main  guideline  for  shaping  the future of the Republic of Belarus. That  is  why  we  cant  forget  occupied  Crimean  peninsula  and  the situation in Eastern Ukraine. Ukraine has our strong and unwavering     support  for  their  sovereignty,  territorial  integrity  and  for  non-recognition  policy  of  the  illegal  annexation  of  Crimea  by  Russia. Security is indivisible – Ukrainian security is also ours. As an elected member  of in the UN Security Council, we  continue to keep the issue of Russia’s aggression  in Donbass and illegal annexation of Crimea on the UNSC agenda.  That  is  why  we  have  to  talk  about  migration  flows  affected  by instability and unrest in different continents. That is why Estonia supports the idea of Summit for Democracy hosted by the President Biden.  That  is  why  Estonia  from  her  side  is  hosting  the  next  Global Conference for Media  Freedom  in  order  to  boost  the  synergies  of internet and media freedom in the situation where journalists and media workers are more and more dependent on internet freedom and modern technologies.  Advancing  media  freedom  goes  also hand in hand with combatting disinformation.  And that is why we continue to support the rights of women and girls around  the  world  –  there  can  be  no  democracy,  no  security  and  no development without one half of the humankind.   When  looking  at  the  future,  we  need  to  talk  about  the  rights  and protection  of  children,  in  particular  in  situations  of  conflict.  In Afghanistan, at least  per cent of the population are children under      years of age – they need protection, access  to education and healthcare, or we add to the never-ending cycle of conflict. Estonia as an elected  member  of the Security Council has  put special emphasis  on the full, equal and meaningful  participation of women in peace processes  and on fighting sexual and gender based violence. We have tried to give a voice to women human rights defenders by inviting them to brief the Security Council. We were also able to draw attention to the ever-deteriorating situation of children in armed  conflicts, which has been even more amplified by COVID-.  Nevertheless,  we know, it is by no means enough. Tangible action is needed more than ever. The  United  Nations  relies  on  “cooperation  in  solving  international problems of  an  economic,  social,  cultural or  humanitarian character”. However, solidarity is achieved in practice only if we follow principles of the solidarity every single day. There is a great potential of solidarity in the UN regardless of the problems we are facing.   If there is a will, there is a way.  Thank you!        "
82,2021,FIN,Finland,"President of the Republic of Finland Sauli Niinist  at the 76th General Debate of the United Nations General Assembly New York,  September 2021 (check against delivery)                             Mr President, Secretary-General, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen,  At the outset, I would like to congratulate Mr Abdulla Shahid for his election as the President of the seventy-sixth session of the General Assembly. I also want to congratulate Mr Antonio Guterres for the re-election for his second term as Secretary-General. Both of you can count on Finland’s full support for your important work.  Finland warmly welcomes the ambitious approach put forward in the Secretary-General’s “Our Common Agenda”. It is easy to agree with one of the key statements in that document: “In our biggest shared test since the Second World War, humanity faces a stark and urgent choice: a breakdown or a breakthrough.”   We are indeed at a critical juncture. If humanity is to make the right choice, a breakthrough rather than a breakdown, we have to shoulder our human responsibilities. Responsibilities for our common future.  The task may seem daunting.The past year has witnessed continued and even growing turbulence in the world. Volatility and uncertainty may easily lead to despair. Common solutions may seem far out of reach. At the same time, many trends highlight how interconnected our world is. The pandemic has had an impact on every one of us. The same will increasingly be true of climate change and emerging technologies alike. Conflicts no longer remain local or regional – they have consequences, direct or indirect, across the globe. All of these cross-border challenges are crying for a global response. With the right mindset, such a response is within reach.  In nineteen-seventy-five, thirty years after the United Nations was founded, thirty-five heads of state and government gathered in the Finnish capital to sign the Helsinki Final Act. The letter of that document, still valid today, focused on security and cooperation in Europe.        But the spirit that arose from that meeting // can have a more global significance, if we succeed in reviving and expanding it. A willingness of adversaries and competitors to engage in dialogue, to build trust, and to seek common denominators – that was the essence of the Helsinki Spirit. Its potential today // is by no means limited to the OSCE area.  It is precisely that kind of a spirit that the entire world, and the United Nations, urgently needs. I am convinced that the more we speak about the Helsinki Spirit, the closer we get to rekindling it – and to making it come true. And that will bring us closer to solving our common challenges together.  Ladies and Gentlemen,  * * * Over a year and half since its beginning, we still live in the shadow of the COVID-nineteen pandemic. Fortunately, there is now some light at the end of the tunnel in many countries. Yet we should resist the temptation to think about health security on a national basis alone. The scientific community has shown a better example than governments. To end this pandemic, the solution has to be global. For a global response to succeed, we need to ensure equitable access to effective remedies. Working through COVAX, Finland is strongly committed to vaccine solidarity. Global action is also needed in order to be better prepared for future pandemics. It is high time to take concrete steps to improve our common health security beyond the current challenges.  To improve our resilience, we need a One Health approach. Enhancing international collaboration on research and development, and exchanging information on emerging threats is vital. We must ensure the effective functioning of the multilateral global health institutions, such as the World Health Organization.         We must also take pause to reflect upon the long-term ramifications of COVID-nineteen. It has led to an increase in extreme poverty and inequality, and resulted in a deterioration of gender equality. It has seriously affected many countries’ ability to reach the Sustainable Development Goals. We must intensify our efforts to ensure that the most vulnerable are not left further behind.  Mr President, * * * The pandemic has shown that a severe enough concern can push us to take unprecedented steps. In a very short order, we all have taken more extreme measures to change our behaviour than any one of us could have imagined before. What would be a sufficient wake-up call for us to do the same for the health of our planet? With the Twenty-thirty Agenda, the Paris Climate Agreement and the Convention on Biological Diversity, we already have plenty of documents and roadmaps to rely on. But talk is not enough. We need to act, and the time for action is now. The rapidly proceeding loss of biodiversity alone should be a cause for immediate global concern. In addition, we now know that climate change is proceeding even faster than was previously thought. According to the IPCC, we are likely to reach the one-point-five degrees temperature rise already in the early twenty-thirties. It is not an exaggeration to say that we are facing a global climate emergency. And yet, that urgency is still not reflected in our deeds. The Nationally Determined Contributions we, the signatories of the Paris Agreement, have made so far, may still put us on a track of a two-point-seven degree temperature rise by the end of this century. The consequences for the planet, and for future generations, would be catastrophic. We have to use the upcoming COP twenty-six conference to put ourselves on a sustainable course. It is our common responsibility, that of governments and        institutions, of companies and individuals, to step up. We need more ambitious emission reduction plans well ahead of the meeting in Glasgow. And we must speed up the ongoing transition away from fossil fuels.  To succeed, we need adequate climate financing. As a global community, we have to increase the quality, quantity and accessibility of climate finance, in particular to the Least Developed Countries and the Small Island Developing States. We must also encourage finance ministers to take climate change into account in all of their decision-making. The Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action, co-chaired by Finland and Indonesia, has already more than sixty members. It currently focuses on green recovery, carbon pricing and biodiversity.We invite more countries to join the work of this coalition. Mr President, * * * The dramatic events of Afghanistan in the past weeks have again reminded us of the fragility of peace and security. The humanitarian needs in Afghanistan are immense, and it is critical that we act together to ensure the access of humanitarian assistance to its people. The UN organizations staying on in Afghanistan play a key role here. And the international community must be steadfast on this: women and girls in Afghanistan must not be forgotten or made invisible. Yet, unfortunately, Afghanistan is just one example. Conflicts, old and new ones, continue to cause human suffering across the world. The diplomatic toolbox of the Charter needs to be used to its full potential, to build peace where needed, and to prevent conflicts where possible. For Finland, conflict prevention and mediation are strong priorities. We continue to be ready and willing to offer our good services for constructive dialogue in this regard.  * * *        Mr President, In its foreign policy, Finland has long underscored the importance of the universal and binding nature of human rights. Our own experience is that a society flourishes // when everyone has an active, equal and meaningful role in it.  Finland is a candidate to the UN Human Rights Council for the period from twenty-twenty-two to twenty-twenty-four. As a member of the Council, we will do our best to make our human rights priorities work for the benefit of peace, stability and prosperity across the world. In our human rights policy, we pay special attention to the rights of those in the most vulnerable situation, the ones most exposed to discrimination.  Promoting the rights of persons with disabilities is a crosscutting priority for Finland. Another key theme for us are the rights of all women and girls. The recently launched Generation Equality campaign, in which Finland co-leads // the Action Coalition on Technology and Innovation, has an important role in mobilizing different actors for gender equality. * * * Mr President, In an era of intensifying great-power competition and rapid technological progress, we are also faced with a serious risk of a new arms race. If the unravelling of the international arms control system is allowed to continue, it reduces predictability and increases the likelihood of unintended escalation. That will make all of us less secure. We urgently need to remedy the situation.            The most important task is to uphold and strengthen the existing arms control architecture. But at the same time, we also need to think ahead with an open mind. We have to develop new solutions to respond to emerging challenges and technologies, by strengthening confidence-building, verification and transparency.  In nuclear arms control, Finland welcomes the extension of New START. Yet it is also clear that engagement between all the nuclear powers would be beneficial for global security. Mr President, * * * The need to come together and to save the planet for the future generations has rarely been greater. For Finland, the UN system is at the core of the rules-based order we want to defend, and the multilateralism we want to strengthen.  No other organization has the same legitimacy or the same normative impact. No other organization gives hope to so many people for a better world. No other organization can deliver the future we want, and the future we deserve. But the United Nations can only succeed if we, its members, want to come together and do what is needed and expected from us. That requires more dialogue.That requires more trust. That requires more Helsinki Spirit from all of us. In this spirit, Finland continues its unwavering support for the United Nations.         "
83,2021,ISL,Iceland,"President, excellencies, ladies, and gentlemen, As we gather to discuss the state of global affairs, today’s challenges may seem overwhelming and almost impossible to overcome.  However, as an optimist and a strong believer in multilateral cooperation, I have for  the  past  five  years  stressed  in  my  message  to  the  General  Assembly  the importance of seeing the world of opportunity, the potential of our cooperation. My message today is no different: we cannot let global challenges divide us. On the contrary, we must for all sake unite.  We have our work cut out for us. Around the world, calls for human rights, peace, and stability are too often ignored. And the threat of climate change is no longer a distant phenomenon: it is here, and it is intensifying. But only together, can we respond and recover. To build a more just and peaceful planet for all of us, we need all nations united, our United Nations. Mr. President,                  While in most developed countries we are turning a corner in our fight against the COVID-, same cannot be said about all of the world. It is critical that we work together to ensure that vaccines reach all countries and peoples – rich and poor – and as soon as possible. Not only is this a fundamental matter of global solidarity, but also in the interest of us all.  Iceland is firmly committed to play its part. We have already contributed  billion Icelandic krona to the COVAX initiative and have started vaccine sharing through the same mechanism.  If anything, the pandemic has taught us that we are stronger together than apart. It has also exposed the dangers of isolationism, disinformation, and distrust.  These lessons should not go to waste.  It is critical that we demonstrate the strength and the honesty needed to learn, both from our successes and our failures, to better prevent, prepare, and respond to future crisis of this magnitude. Mr. President,  While the consequences of the pandemic have been disastrous for our world, the effects of climate change are bound to be even worse.  The  science  and  the  signs  are  clear  and  sobering,  and  the  plans  are  already  in place. We need to respond now and honour our commitments from Paris as we set our eyes on Glasgow. For our part, Iceland’s ambition is to go beyond the Paris commitments.              This includes a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by more than half by 2030, complete carbon neutrality by 2040 and becoming fossil-fuel free by 2050.  All of Iceland’s electricity and close to % of Iceland’s total energy consumption comes from renewables.  We aim to close the gap with electrification of transport and  green  hydrogen  and  e-fuels  for  heavy  transport  and  machinery,  fishing, shipping and aviation. Our long-term energy policy also focuses on substantially increasing energy efficiency and multiple use of energy resources. Capturing and binding carbon is also an important pillar of our efforts, where we use  both  tried  and  tested  nature-based  solutions  and  innovative  technologies. Iceland is home to the world’s largest plant that extracts carbon dioxide directly from  the  air  and  turns  it  into  rock  through  the  so-called  Carbfix  method.  This technology has been developed out of the geothermal energy industry and will be applicable in many corners of the world to capture and store CO2 as solid-state rock. Focusing on our own homework, however, is not enough. High-income countries must  support  lower  income  ones  to  advance  their  climate  ambitions  too.  I  am pleased to share that Iceland’s contribution to international climate finance  has more than doubled from 2018.  But Iceland’s main contribution in the fight against climate change will continue to be our knowledge and experience in the use of green energy solutions. This is a global crisis, and we must rely on each other’s expertise and knowledge.  Iceland  is  ready  to  play  its  part.  As  a  Global  Champion  for  Just  and  Inclusive Energy  Transition,  Iceland  actively  promotes  the  goal  of  achieving  sustainable energy for all. Iceland has for decades contributed to this global agenda, through        research, training, sharing of experience, and cooperation. As a Global Champion, we are now scaling up our efforts even further.  Mr. President, The health of the World Oceans - our Blue Planet - is increasingly under pressure. Climate change, mismanagement, and pollution are leading to food insecurities, an alarming fall in biodiversity, and depletion of natural resources.  We must take concrete steps to make regional and international cooperation on Ocean Affairs stronger. And we must base our actions on the best scientific advice and the Law of the Sea – the very constitution of the Ocean.  Much can be learned from successful regional cooperation. The Arctic Council is a great example, which brings together governments, indigenous peoples, science, and various stakeholders to share knowledge and shape policy and action.  During  Iceland’s  recent  chairmanship  of  the  Council,  a  special  emphasis  was placed on protecting marine and coastal ecosystems, resulting in a regional action plan to address marine litter in the Arctic. A small but important step in the right direction.  Iceland  is  also  among  the  group  of  countries  pushing  for  a  global agreement to fight marine plastic pollution.  Nature  is  firmly  on  our  agenda  in  the  coming  months,  including  at  the  COP meetings on climate change, biodiversity, and desertification, as well as the UN Ocean Conference. Ecosystem restoration, both on land and in the oceans, is yet another pressing global issue that must be tackled in unison by the international community. We need to connect the dots and focus on stronger commitments and more robust implementation.             This is the Decade of Action. The time to act is now. Mr. President, In recovering from the pandemic, we cannot revert to business as usual. We need to do better, and build a greener, bluer, and more equitable and sustainable future. The groundwork has already been laid with the 2030 Agenda. The Sustainable Development Goals are our global compass, and the Decade of Action reminds us of the urgency at hand. Iceland is committed to promote SDG implementation at home and abroad. The Global  Goals  guide  our  growing  official  development  assistance,  under  the overarching objective of poverty reduction and a strong focus on human rights, including gender equality, rights of children and LGBTI.  Recognising  the  essential  role  of  broad  ownership  and  involvement  for development success, Iceland is also supporting private sector partners and civil society  in  their  development  and  humanitarian  work,  making  full  use  of  their strength  and  know-how.  Without  the  participation  and  inclusion  of  the  private sector we will not achieve our goals. Iceland’s own experience speaks volumes about the value of inclusiveness and equality for sustainable development, particularly the importance of working for gender equality for economic and social progress. Advances have been made globally, but there is still a long way to go. Gender parity is too far off, gender-based violence is rampant, and millions of girls  are           married off as child brides. Men and boys must join forces with women and girls to advance gender equality globally, from the locker rooms to the halls of power.  Overall, human rights and liberal democracy - enabling people to share thoughts and ideas freely - are essential drivers for  sustainable development, along with free trade and open markets. Including everyone, irrespective of gender, sexual orientation,  or  race,  means  more  hands  and  minds  pushing  for  social  and economic progress for all. Mr. President,  Building  back  better  requires  greater  respect  for  human  rights,  fundamental freedoms, and gender equality - the critical cornerstones for a better and more just future.   Indeed, investing in development, peace, and human rights will, at the end of the day,  always  be  less  expensive  than  having  to  address  the  dire  consequences  of poverty, war, and injustice. Regrettably,  today’s  conflicts,  humanitarian  and  political  crises  are  too  often rooted in lack of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.  This  year,  we  have  witnessed  a  ruthless  military  coup  in  Myanmar,  where democracy and civil rights have been done away with altogether. The situation in Afghanistan  is  highly  troubling,  with  reports  of  attacks,  serious  violations  of international  humanitarian  law,  and  human  rights  abuses,  including  push  back against women’s rights. The Taliban and other parties must respect international          law, seek an inclusive political settlement, and ensure humanitarian access and safe passage for all, or else be held accountable. In too many places, we have seen a serious decline of respect for civil and political rights. We need to stand by those who risk their lives and liberties every day for calling out these injustices and engaging in an open, democratic debate. We have a collective duty to promote and protect the human rights and freedom of all. The role of the Human Rights Council has never been as important as now. We need to engage in an open dialogue on how to correct the course and head towards greater  respect  for  human  rights  and  fundamental  freedoms,  everywhere  and always.  The  run-up  to  the  75th  anniversary  of  the  Universal  Declaration  for Human Rights in 2023 should be used to reinvigorate our collective commitments to human rights. Iceland is firmly committed to continue actively promoting and defending human rights. We have therefore decided to run for a seat on the Human Rights Council for the term 2025-2027.  Mr. President,  The  complexity  of  modern  conflicts  and  crises  continues  to  grow  with  the marriage  of  emerging  factors,  such  as  climate  change,  cyber  threats  and disinformation, and the old foes of authoritarianism and tyranny.  While encouraging steps have been taken to preserve and build peace, including in Iraq and Libya, the overall trend is nothing short of disappointing.            This year’s surge of violence in Palestine and Israel underlined the importance of finding ways to reinvigorate the Middle East Peace Process. Its current stagnation will only serve to deepen existing disagreements and feed senseless extremism.  Finding political solutions to the situations in Syria, Yemen, Ethiopia, and now Afghanistan is also essential, as military might alone can never deliver peace and stability.  The  same  holds  true  for  Russia’s  persistent  and  unlawful  violations  of  the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and Georgia, which continues to undermine regional stability.  The  UN’s  role  in  pursuing  diplomacy  and  providing  humanitarian  and development assistance is indispensable. We are all responsible for creating and safeguarding the space for diplomacy and humanitarian work.  Still, the Security Council carries special responsibilities on behalf of the wider UN  membership.  The  Council  needs  to  act  with  greater  foresight  based  on  a broader  view  of  security,  and  we  welcome  its  recent  deliberations  on  cyber security, climate security and the pandemic. At the same time, it is about time that we  instil  new  life  in  the  Security  Council  reform  discussions,  which  need  to become more substantive, and results focused. Prevention  needs  to  be  our  highest  priority,  given  human  cost  and  long-term implications  of  conflict,  instability,  and  tensions.  Safeguarding  the  key agreements that brought us out  of the wasteful arms race of the Cold War, not least the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, is particularly important. Mr. President,           There is no international platform that compares to the United Nations.  No other body  can  bring  together  different  nationalities,  religions,  and  political  views  - literally under one roof.  It symbolises humanity’s greatest aspirations and represents a beacon of hope, not least for those stricken by conflict, poverty, inequality, and discrimination.  The  UN  Charter  and  international  law  need  to  continue  to  be  our  lodestars. Without  them,  we  will  be  lost  and  swayed  by  those  seeking  narrow  national interests and zero-sum games. But, to stay relevant, it is critical that the UN evolves with the times.  We  need  more  transparency  and  openness  within  the  UN  system  and  among Member States.  And, perhaps most importantly, we need to bring the UN closer to the people of the world.  The UN75  Declaration provides us with a strong  vision and framework for the future. I also welcome the Secretary-Generals report on Our Common Agenda on present and future challenges,  Mr. President,  Today’s  challenges  may  seem  overwhelming,  seen  from  the  perspective  of individual nations acting alone.               Still, united in hope and will, and by delivering on our commitments, we can meet these  challenges  and  deliver  on  the  promises  set  out  in  the  UN  Charter  to safeguard peace, human rights, and development.  Our future depends on it.  Thank you.                           "
84,2021,IRL,Ireland,"President, Excellencies, Distinguished heads of state and governments, Esteemed heads of delegations, Mr Secretary-General, Friends, This week, in this hall, a series of alarms have sounded: - they have sounded for conflict; - they have sounded for COVID;  - they have sounded for climate.  We have heard the alarms – now we must respond.  I believe that this is what the General Assembly – our Assembly of Nations – was created to do - our purpose, our obligation.         The United Nations is a symbol of hope for billions of people around the world. P a g e  |  The UN flag, a beacon of peace across the globe.  The blue helmets, guardians to the most vulnerable.  UN convoys, a lifeline to millions.  The obligation we assume in this hall is to transform that hope, in the face of our common challenges, into a better future for all our peoples.  Mr President, Today, the climate crisis threatens our very existence on this shared and endangered planet.  The COVID- pandemic has cast a shadow over our world.  It has deepened global inequality, even as it has heightened our sense of interdependence.           P a g e  |  The  people  of  the  world  now  look  to  us,  to  this  General Assembly Hall, to act and to lead.  We cannot let them down. The simple fact is that we cannot succeed in addressing these global challenges without a strong, effective and fair multilateral system.  As we begin to emerge from the shadow of the pandemic, let us do so more united in our resolve, and firm in our conviction that the United Nations delivers for those who rely on it most.  Let  us  commit  to  tackling  this  pandemic  together,  to  make “leave no one behind” more than a mere slogan. In our words, and, more importantly in our deeds.  Mr President,  Vaccine inequity is a moral test for our global community.          P a g e  |  The rapid establishment of COVAX and the ACT Accelerator represents multilateralism at its best. I urge all Member States to continue to support the COVAX mechanism. This is the only way we can meet the target of a fully vaccinated world by mid-2022. Ireland is in the process of donating . million vaccine doses to low income countries, mainly through COVAX, with a further significant donation planned in 2022. Our support to global health since the outbreak of the pandemic has reached over €200 million.  The World Health Organisation should remain at the heart of our global response to this and future pandemics. However, we must provide it with the political and financial support it needs to do this job. In Ireland, we have quadrupled funding to the WHO in response to the pandemic. We must also consider change, where needed, to strengthen the multilateral architecture on pandemic prevention and response.  Mr President,       P a g e  |  When we reflect on the last eighteen months, one thing is clear: the pandemic caught the world off-guard.  It has put into stark relief the simple, and regrettable, fact that  -  we have not made sufficient progress in reducing poverty;   -  that we have not made sufficient progress in increasing access to quality health care and education;  -  nor, in combatting the climate crisis.  Had we made more progress in the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, our societies would have been more resilient, better prepared to weather the storm, and lives would have been spared. We have less than a decade to achieve these ambitious global goals. We have a rare opportunity now to build back fairer, greener and better. The SDGs provide us with the blueprint. So too, does Our Common Agenda – the Secretary-General’s vision for a future of global cooperation through an inclusive,       networked, and effective multilateralism. It is incumbent upon all of us to grasp this moment, to invest in a better world for P a g e  |  all.  Mr President, For Ireland, our membership of the European Union has shown us:   - that pooling our sovereignty enhances, not diminishes it;  - that abiding by international law brings immeasurable benefits; and - that our commitment to multilateralism is not simply a stock phrase to insert into a speech, but is at the heart of who we are as a nation and as a people.  Last year, in my address to this Assembly, I assured you that Ireland was ready to assume its responsibility at the Security Council. A responsibility entrusted to us by you, our fellow members of the General Assembly.          P a g e  |  We do not take this responsibility lightly. Our own experience of conflict on the island of Ireland has taught us that building peace is painstaking, long and often frustrating. We expected that our time on the Council would reflect that complexity; would require stamina, ingenuity, compromise and determination. And so it has proved.  Every day for the last nine months, we have sought to use our voice, to defend our principles, and to make progress towards the peaceful resolution of some of the world’s most pressing conflicts.  Progress has not always been possible. Too often, the Council has been divided. It is a lesson hard learned that when we, in this building, are divided, it is the most vulnerable who suffer the consequences.  The promise of the Charter is to “save succeeding generations from the scourge of war”. Today, I call on all members of the      Council to set aside political differences and to work to uphold that promise.  P a g e  |  Syria presents an urgent example of where this is needed.  This year we marked ten years of conflict in that country. For many, the conflict in Syria is emblematic as the failure of the United Nations and of the Security Council in particular. On too many occasions, in the face of immense suffering, the Council chose inaction.  Often, in response, it has been the General Assembly that has stepped up, and stepped in. This body has taken bold action, critical to the resolution of this conflict.  With Norway, Ireland is leading work in the Security Council to ensure that humanitarian aid continues to reach all those who need it in Syria.  In July, the Council acted as one when it adopted Resolution 2585. That Resolution ensured the continuation of the vital UN operation, which provides aid to . million people in North West Syria.         P a g e  |  But humanitarian aid cannot be a substitute for political will. What13 million Syrians in need of humanitarian assistance require most is a political solution.  Mr. President, Since January, Ireland has consistently urged the Council to act in response to the deteriorating situation in the Tigray region of Ethiopia.  We have been horrified by reports of gross human rights abuses and violations, including widespread and systematic sexual and gender-based violence. For  months, a humanitarian catastrophe has unfolded before our eyes. The threat of famine looms large. This is unconscionable.  We are speaking out clearly here today, as we have done in the Council for months. We must stand firm and united in support of the Secretary-General’s call for a negotiated ceasefire, unimpeded humanitarian access and restoration of       basic services to all affected areas, and a political solution to P a g e  |  the crisis.   Mr. President, A hallmark of Irish foreign policy is our firm commitment to a world free of nuclear weapons.  Next week at the Security Council, we will mark the 25th anniversary of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.  We are committed to achieving a successful and substantive outcome to the Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference.  We warmly welcome the entry-into-force of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.  As Security Council Facilitator for Resolution 2231 on the Iran nuclear deal we have engaged extensively to encourage a return to compliance by all parties.          We welcome the commitment of the US Administration to return to the agreement.  P a g e  |  We urge Iran to seize this opportunity, to return swiftly to talks in Vienna, and to come back into full compliance with the agreement, including by cooperating fully with the International Atomic Energy Agency.   Excellencies  The escalation of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict in May resulted in more lives lost, including the deaths of more than  children.  Ireland was deeply frustrated by the Council’s inability to speak throughout this latest outbreak of hostilities. While we welcomed the Press Statement agreed on  May, it was too little, too late.  A comprehensive, just and lasting peace is possible.  Ireland is committed to achieving a two State solution, with a viable State of Palestine based on the 1967 borders, alongside       the State of Israel, living in peace and security, with Jerusalem as the capital of both states. P a g e  |  Young people – Palestinians and Israelis – are losing hope that peace can be achieved. As leaders, we must act now.   I call on the international community to come together to renew efforts for a just and lasting resolution, including through a reinvigorated Quartet.  Mr. President, Excellencies The world has watched in horror at the violence and chaos in Afghanistan.   Millions of Afghans require urgent support, including those recently displaced by conflict, violence and intimidation. Full, safe and unimpeded access to humanitarian organisations and all of their personnel, regardless of gender, must be facilitated.  The most vulnerable – women, girls, boys, men, LGBTQI persons; and persons with disabilities – must be protected.  The situation of Afghan women and girls has been foremost in our thoughts.           P a g e  |  Over the last twenty years, Afghan women have asserted their rights, and continue to assert their rights.  These rights include full and equal access to education; the right to health care; the right to freedom of movement in their own country; and the right to participate fully in public life. Women and girls have been educated in enormous numbers, and have been leading and participating in all aspects of society. They refuse to be silenced, to be erased from public life. Our role and responsibility is to stand with them. So much has been achieved in the past twenty years. There can be no going back.  For all of us in this Hall, we can and must agree that the rights of Afghan women and girls be a non-negotiable principle.  Excellencies,  At its best, United Nations peacekeeping is a remarkable and meaningful expression of multilateralism and international solidarity.  We have always seen this service as a noble and important calling.          P a g e  |  For more than six decades, Irish women and men have served. Every village, town and neighbourhood in our island has bid farewell to a blue beret upon deployment and counted the days to their return. Some never made it home.  Today, there are over 500 Irish personnel serving in UN and EU peacekeeping and crisis management operations.  Every person who serves in a blue helemet deserves a mandate that matches the reality of the conflict on the ground, and that resources in turn match mandates. Equally, the transition from peacekeeping to peacebuilding is a critical moment, when sustainable peace is within our grasp but often times at its most fragile.  Resolution 2594, led by Ireland and adopted unanimously earlier this month by the Council with the support of  members of this Assembly, sends a strong and united message that the United Nations is committed to supporting its members through this sensitive juncture on the path to peace. There can be no gaps when it comes to protecting civilians.      P a g e  |  Excellencies  In Ireland, we have learned the importance of an inclusive approach to building peace.  Those who make war cannot, and should not, have a monopoly on the terms of peace. It is crucial that women, young people, and civil society – who are often excluded – are at the centre of our shared work to build and maintain peace. The promotion of gender equality, and the Women, Peace and Security agenda is a golden thread throughout our work.  Human rights are universal and indivisible. They belong to us all. We will not falter in calling for full compliance with international law, including international humanitarian law, international human rights law and international refugee law.  We will stand by the International Criminal Court, the cornerstone of the international system of criminal justice. Excellencies,        P a g e  |  Yesterday, I had the privilege to chair a Council debate on climate and security.  As we heard from the Secretary-General on Tuesday, we can no longer deny the reality: climate change is the single greatest challenge facing our generation.  Its impact is devastating on our environment and ecosystems and our collective security is at risk. We have seen, time and time again, that the most catastrophic impacts disproportionately affect the most vulnerable and the least responsible.  We must deliver on the Paris Agreement commitments and we will shortly have important discussions at COP . But we can see the adverse effects of climate change already exacerbating conflict and insecurity, compounding other drivers of conflict such as poverty, inequality and human rights violations.        P a g e  |  We have ample evidence of this. As Co-Chair of the Informal Expert Group on Climate and Security, along with Niger, Ireland has worked throughout the year with our fellow Council members, to better understand these links; to inform the Council as to what steps we can take to address climate-related security risks. We know not all Council Members are of one mind on this.My hope is that by working together, we can and we wil reach a shared understanding of how the Security Council can meet the challenge of climate and security.  There is no time to waste. For this reason, in the coming days, Ireland will convene a discussion on a thematic Security Council resolution on climate and security. Excellencies,  At COP26, we must all, North and South of this vulnerable planet, muster the courage to take bold and ambitious action.      We need to keep global warming to as close to .5⁰ Celsius as possible.  P a g e  |  For our part, Ireland will reduce our emissions by % by 2030 compared to 2018 levels. Along with our partners in the European Union, we will achieve net neutrality by 2050.   It is also critical that we meet our collective commitment to provide 100 billon dollars in financing to developing countries. We cannot fail – our future depends on it.  Mr. President, Excellencies,  We can all identify times when we, the United Nations, have fallen short. The UN can only do what we ask of it when we, its members, allow it; when we deliver the resources, the support, the political will and the constructive engagement needed for it to deliver.          P a g e  |  As  I  stand  here  today,  I  am  reminded  of  the  ambitions,  the goals, and the dreams of billions of people. They have placed their trust in us, and they expect us to work together to solve the greatest challenges facing our global community.  We know that with political will, we can be deserving of that trust. Mr. President,  Ireland will continue to play our part, to build consensus and to advocate fiercely for the multilateral system and the people we have pledged to serve.  Thank you.      "
85,2021,LVA,Latvia,"President of Latvia speech Building resilience through hope – to recover from COVID19, rebuild sustainably, respond to the needs of the planet, respect the rights of people, and revitalise the United Nations Mr President, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen! . Let  me  begin  by  congratulating  you,  Minister  of Foreign Affairs of the Maldives, Mr Abdulla Shahid, on taking up the honourable position of President of the 76th Session of the UN General Assembly. I can assure you of Latvia’s full cooperation.  . I also warmly welcome the appointment of Antonio Guterres as UN Secretary-General for another term. The Secretary-General has made considerable efforts to  strengthen  the  effectiveness  of  the  UN  system. The  new  report  by  the  Secretary-General,  namely “Our Common Agenda”, provides us with a vision and choices for the future.     Pandemic challenges and solutions . The Covid- pandemic has not yet been overcome.  . The current global challenge is to achieve the widest possible vaccination as soon as possible.      . Latvia provides support to increase the availability of vaccines  worldwide.  Latvia  has  sent  vaccines  to  its closest neighbours, as well as friends in Africa and Asia,  and  we  plan  to  continue  to  share  vaccines, including through the COVAX mechanism. Disinformation . This crisis has highlighted the need to continuously strengthen the resilience of countries and societies. COVID-  highlighted  the  vulnerability  of  our societies to all kinds of disinformation.  . Latvia's  response  to  combating  disinformation  is based on strengthening public resilience - by raising awareness strengthening independent and pluralistic media; the involvement of civil society; and teaching media literacy.  disinformation; of . Combating such disinformation  that creates  serious harm to society, while protecting and strengthening freedom of expression and data privacy in the digital world, is an extremely complex challenge.  The lines between  freedom  of  speech,  accountability  and censorship are thin and fragile. . The freedom of expression as a universal human right can be limited only in extreme cases. Such limitations should  not  be  managed  by  the  global internet in  democratic  societies,  this platforms. Instead,    function  should  be  exercised  only  by  democratically mandated institutions.   . At  the  global level,  combating  disinformation effectively  requires  even  closer  understanding  and cooperation in international organizations. Latvia was one of the initiators of the UN General Assembly resolution on  the  promotion  of  media  and  information  literacy  at the global level adopted this year.  .  We will continue to provide support to partners with our expertise in  combating  disinformation.  Efforts at the UN level need to be strengthened. Investment in sustainable digital solutions  . Latvia was one of the first countries in the world to for  a important develop  several  digital  solutions sustainable response to the pandemic.  . Due to the fact that almost every corner of Latvia has access  to  high-speed  internet,  many  people  have  used these solutions during the pandemic to change their habits and shape their daily lives. . They  contribute,  inter  alia,  to  the  convergence  of quality of life and income levels between urban and rural areas.  In  many  cases,  digital  solutions  have  reduced  the need to commute, which helps to limit emissions.    . At the same time, we must bear in mind that digital transformation and artificial intelligence poses new risks. Also, security threats in cyberspace are increasing.  . in Therefore, technological developments, we must work actively to define new legal principles.   parallel  with . On  the  one  hand  these  principles  should  help  us make the best use of opportunities and, on the other, to avoid risks and damage to human rights and freedoms.  . In  recent  years  we  see  innovations  which,  through global  social  platforms  and  increasing  use  of  artificial intelligence, make it possible to influence and manipulate human thoughts and actions more effectively.   . Thus,  human  autonomy,  the  free  will  of  the personality  is  endangered.    The  main  challenge  for  the democratic world in the coming decades will be whether artificial intelligence or humans control decisions.   .  When individual  scientists  and  environmental activists began to express concerns about climate issues in the 1990s, few listened to them.  It takes time for public opinion and legal consciousness to mature.   . Today we are grateful to them for raising the alarm early.    Looking  ahead,  I  consider  the  protection  of autonomy  of  human  thought  to  be  the  most  important task for legal policy in the coming decades.    .  We must also ensure that the digital transformation is inclusive for all countries and  all people, bridging the current digital divide.  . is Another for  Latvia important  aspect the preservation  of  linguistic  diversity  and  the  use  of  small languages  in  the  digital  age.  Latvian  digital  technology companies  are  developing  a  high-quality  machine translation program for small languages. This will help to safeguard linguistic diversity in the digital age. . Latvia  is  also  proud  of  the  project  ""RigaTechGirls"", which  offers  better  digital  skills  and  opportunities  to women. We are happy to share this experience with others through the UN system. . Latvia  supports  the  UN  Technology  Facilitation Mechanism  to  identify  how  science,  technology  and innovation  can  best  contribute  to  delivering  sustainable development goals. Climate / environment Mr President, . There is an urgent need to reach our common goals on  the  environment,  climate  change  and  renewable energy. . The  COP26  climate  change  conference  in  Glasgow later this year will be an important milestone.     . Latvia is committed to meeting the goals of the Paris Climate  Agreement  and  has  adopted  an  ambitious development  strategy  that  aims  to  minimize  carbon production. . There  is  a  need  to  make  greater  use  of  innovative technologies  for  the  prudent  and  sustainable  use  of its natural  resources.  Latvia  continues  to  expand experience of sustainable forest management using digital technologies. . In the coming years, we will continue to pay special attention to the issue of clean water in a national, regional and global context.  . Latvia  has  a  long  coastline.  We  can  share  our accumulated knowledge about monitoring and combating marine pollution. Latvia is also actively involved in the UN Group of Friends to Combat Marine Plastic Pollution. SDG16, Human Rights, Security  Mr President, .  With  regard  to  the  UN  Sustainable  Development Goals, we are especially committed to promoting peace, justice and good governance.   . It is good governance that is crucial for respect for all human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law.    .  Therefore,  in  its  development  cooperation,  Latvia focuses on public administration, the rule of law, gender equality and environmental protection. .  More than ever, human rights need to be a strategic priority for the UN.  . Over  the  past  year,  we  have  witnessed  negative developments in regard to basic human rights and security issues, for example in Myanmar and Tigray.  .

Over  the  past  year,  Latvia  has  also  closely  followed the  dramatic  developments  in  its  neighbouring  country  Belarus, where public efforts to decide on the future of its country are still being brutally suppressed.  . Latvia  strongly  condemns  the  actions  of  the Lukashenko  regime  against  Belarusian  civil  society, independent media and journalists. It has even gone so far as to hijack an international flight.  . Belarus  exploits  and  puts  at  great  risk  vulnerable people from different regions of the world in an effort to   create  targeted,  intensive  migratory  flows  to  Lithuania, Latvia and Poland, in order to destabilize Europe.  .

86,2021,LTU,Lithuania,"President of the Republic of Lithuania Gitanas Nausėda at the United Nations General Assembly  September 2021 Mr. President, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, This  year  marks  a  special  anniversary  for  the  independent Lithuanian state. Thirty years ago, the Republic of Lithuania became a member of the United Nations. We  had  been  striving  for  international  recognition  ever  since  the restoration of independence in March 1990. Membership in the United Nations has made Lithuania a full-fledged member of the international community. It empowered us to seek peace, to defend human rights and to contribute to effective multilateralism.  A  significant  decision  of  the  United  Nations  General  Assembly  was made  in  1992  to  call  for  a  complete  withdrawal  of  foreign  military forces  from  the  territories  of  the  Baltic  States.  It  was  a  powerful manifestation  of  global  solidarity.  A  kind  of  solidarity  we  still  often need today! Recent years have shown us that no country is able to deal with global challenges  alone.  It  is  a  global  effort  that  helps  us  to  mitigate  the consequences of the COVID- pandemic. This fight is not over. However, I believe we are on the right path.     The  way  forward  goes  through  the  widespread  use  of  safe  and effective  vaccines.  We  need  an  active  global  vaccine  sharing mechanism that would help to protect everyone, including those who are the most vulnerable.  Alarmingly, the pandemic is deepening global poverty and inequality. The  widening  gaps in  education,  social  security,  and  digital connectivity divide the global population.  Right  now,  millions  of  people  are  also  being  overwhelmed  by  a dangerous infodemic. It too causes much suffering and contributes to many  untimely  deaths.  Therefore,  I  would  like  to  congratulate  the efforts of the United Nations, especially by the Verified campaign, in fighting misinformation and disinformation. They pose an ever greater threat to our societies. To counter various kinds of manipulations, we need  a  holistic  approach  and  concrete  new  ways  to  get  better  in detecting, analyzing, and exposing disinformation. Ladies and Gentlemen, various forms of pressure and hybrid attacks are closely related to the deteriorating  security  situation  in  many  parts  of  the  world.  We  have seen  authoritarian  states  continuing  their  military  buildups  and intensifying violent crackdowns on political opposition, free media, and civil society. These regimes demonstrated many times their willingness to endanger our peace, security, and prosperity.   We  refuse  to  accept  such  behaviour  as  the  ‘new  normal’.  Therefore, Lithuania  fully  supports  the  calls  to  uphold  human  rights  in  all countries.  Such  cases  when  political  activists  and  human  rights defenders are tortured and killed must be carefully investigated. We  also  deplore  efforts  by  Russia  to  exert  pressure  on  Lithuanian judges and prosecutors who investigate the case of atrocities committed by the occupying Soviet army in Lithuania in 1991. Lithuania calls on all states not to execute related international arrest warrants. It is also with deep sadness that I remember last year’s developments in Belarus.  A  genuine  protest  movement  that  sprang  up  after  a  rigged presidential  election  has  been  brutally  suppressed.  Independent  civil society and media organizations are being silenced, hundreds of people – detained, severely beaten, tortured. The irresponsible actions by the Belarusian authorities might also have  a  bigger  impact  on  international  security.  We  saw  it  in  the hijacking and forced landing of the Ryanair flight on May . It was done  in  clear  violation  of  international  law.  Such  actions  should  be treated as an act of state-sponsored terrorism. The Belarusian regime is also testing new methods of hybrid actions. For  several  months  now,  Lithuania  has  been  dealing  with  an unprecedented  hybrid  attack.  By  artificially  creating  and  directing flows of irregular migration, Belarus aims to put political pressure on the European Union.   Lithuania firmly rejects this attempt at sowing discord and calls on the United  Nations  to  address  it.  We  all  need  to  actively  fight  human trafficking,  break  the  business  model  of  smugglers,  and  discourage migrants  from  endangering  their  lives.  There  must  be  serious discussions on how to prevent a country to use irregular migration to pressure another country. We must make it clear that people should not be used as tools. Furthermore,  Belarus  has  recently  generated  yet  another  outrage  by starting the commercial exploitation of an unsafe nuclear power plant close  to  the  Lithuanian  border.  By  ignoring  numerous  worrying incidents  and  failing  to  comply  with  basic  international  safety standards, the Belarusian regime has once again shown a complete lack of a sense of responsibility. I believe that it would be a colossal mistake to treat such violators on the  same  footing  as  climate  friendly  producers  who  respect environmental  and  nuclear  safety  rules.  Solving  the  issue  of  the Belarusian  nuclear  power  plant  is  crucially  important  for  our environment – and a matter of safety for all the people of Europe.       Ladies and Gentlemen, For  the  seventh  year  we  are  witnessing  the  continuing  military aggression  against  Ukraine,  as  well  as  the  illegal  annexation  and occupation  of  Crimea.  These  actions  violate  international  law,  the Charter of the United Nations, as well as the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act. They should be condemned universally. We must reinforce the policy of non-recognition of the occupation and annexation of Crimea. It is also extremely important to protect the rights and freedoms of the local civilian population. I commend the Ukrainian effort  to  keep  this  issue  on  the  agenda  by  creating  the  International Crimean Platform. Lithuania  respects  Ukraine’s  European  and  Euro-Atlantic  choice  and continues  to  support  its  reforms  in  this  troubled  period.  Seeking  to consolidate  international  efforts,  we  have  co-hosted  the  Ukraine Reform Conference in Vilnius this past July. Currently,  we  are  also  witnessing  a  worsening  human  rights  and security situation in the Abkhazia and Tskhinvali regions of Georgia.  Aggressive  actions  of  the  occupying  forces,  such  as  ‘borderization’, movement restrictions and illegal detentions, are hindering the lives of the local people. Our duty is to make the aggressor accountable.     The  international  community  may  also  give  special  attention  to comprehensive  settlement  of  the  Transnistrian  conflict  based  on  the sovereignty  and territorial integrity  of  Moldova  within its internationally recognised borders. Ladies and Gentlemen, We  are  being  constantly  reminded  about  the  need  to  preserve  the international rules-based order. As we have inherited it, our duty is to pass it to the next generations. We must show restraint on international matters and implement our commitments and obligations. The Open Skies Treaty, the Vienna Document, the Conventional Armed Forces  in  Europe  Treaty,  and  many  other  agreements  are  crucial  for building  confidence  in  international  security.  The  principles  of sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity should prevail in the face of new challenges. For  the  United  Nations  to  remain  relevant  and  strong,  an  efficient Security Council is required. Every instance of inaction by the Security Council encourages aggression and threatens the multilateral system.  Lithuania therefore strongly supports the initiative on limiting the use of veto in the Security Council in cases of mass atrocities, genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.    To express Lithuania’s strong commitment to the international human rights  agenda,  we  are  also  running  for  a  seat  at  the  United  Nations Human Rights Council for 2022-2024. If  elected,  Lithuania  will  pay  special  attention  to  the  protection  of human  rights  defenders,  the  rights  of  the  child,  the  rights  of  persons with  disabilities,  as  well  as  human  rights  in  conflict  areas.  We  will continue defending the rights of women and girls, freedom of peaceful assembly and association, freedom of religion and belief, and stand up for ensuring access to information and the safety of journalists. To fulfil these promises, Lithuania will make use of experience gained by  membership  in  various  United  Nations  bodies.  As  the  current President of the Executive Board of the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF),  Lithuania  is  engaged  in  international  efforts  to  save children’s lives and to defend their rights.  Seeking to make a change, Lithuania has also presented its candidacy for election to the UNESCO Executive Board for 2021-2025. We are ready to promote UNESCO’s mission and mandate, and to contribute to making the organization more efficient, responsive, and keen to find sustainable solutions. Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to turn now to the challenge of our time – climate change.     The recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change1 has clearly stated that we have little time left for necessary decisions and real actions.  Lithuania fully supports the Secretary General of the United Nations in his  call  “for  the  urgent  and  bold  steps  to  address  the  triple  crisis  of climate  disruption,  biodiversity  loss  and  pollution  destroying  our planet.”  It  is  crucially  important  for  every  country  to  turn  up  at  the upcoming COP26 meeting in Glasgow with most ambitious proposals. Lithuania seeks a timely transition towards resilient and climate neutral economy and is committed to reaching related EU targets. The recently adopted National Climate Change Management Agenda sets goals for Lithuania to reduce emissions by  percent compared to 1990 and to become climate neutral by 2050. Wide support of society is needed for the decarbonization efforts to be effective.  They  must  bring  new  major  opportunities  and  benefits  of innovative  green  growth,  employment,  higher  quality  of  life,  public health, and biodiversity. The shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy is inevitable. The real question now is who will be the first to reap the benefits.  IPCC     Lithuania has earlier used its chances for early digital transformation, with  advances in  modern information  and  communication infrastructure jumpstarting a fast growth of digital economy. We intend to do the same with green transformation. Ladies and Gentlemen, We  have  always  shared  one  world.  But  only  recently  have  we  been  awakened to the fact of our shared responsibility.  Now we know that we have to make an effort. We must actively build our common future. The time for passive observation is gone.  We do clearly need a new social contract anchored in human rights, as well as a better management of our global commons. How can all of this be achieved? I believe that the way forward goes through an honest and open discussion. Our success relies on our ability to  build  trust  among  peoples,  and  to  make  it  work  for  the  whole humanity. Our hopes, our brave ideas, and our individual strengths should all be channelled into global efforts. Let us build our future together! Thank you.   "
87,2021,NOR,Norway,"President, Excellencies, We are contending with three crises at the same time: a climate crisis, a health crisis, and an economic crisis. All of them call for a coordinated response. All of them underline why we need international cooperation.  We need to remind ourselves of our collective strength. The United Nations was born out of crisis. Because crises have the potential to increase unity and resolve. We must harness the momentum created and take action. (Climate) President,  We know the path we need to take – and we have a plan: The 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals are the roadmap to the world we want.  Let me start with climate change.  We are already living with the impacts. Just ask the many people who have witnessed devastating famine, floods and forest fires. Together, we will work to limit temperature increase to . degrees, in line with the goal of the Paris Agreement.  The transition to a low-emission society will require profound change. But it will also create opportunities for employment and growth. To ensure a fair and just transition, we must cut emissions – not jobs. We must invest in renewables and new technology. We must put a price on carbon. Investors and businesses will rise to the challenge once the right incentives are in place.  Many countries have enhanced their targets. More countries, especially large economies, need to raise their ambition level ahead of COP26.  We are doing our part. Norway's new target is to cut emissions by at least  % - and towards  % - by 2030.  We will also continue to partner with developing countries in their efforts to achieve climate-resilient and sustainable development. (Ocean) President, To tackle climate change, we urgently need to restore the health of the ocean. Healthy and productive oceans can help us achieve the SDGs. We know what has to be done. The High-level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy has presented an ambitious action agenda. This should form the basis for discussions on the oceans moving forward. Effective protection, sustainable production and equitable prosperity must go hand in hand. Without healthy oceans, we all face an uncertain future.                   NORWAY – Prime Minister – Mrs. Erna Solberg The Ocean Panel members have made a commitment to sustainably manage all of their ocean areas by 2025. That is one third of the worlds exclusive economic zones.  This is a bold target. But our ambition is even bolder:  We call on all ocean and coastal states to make a similar commitment by 2030. (Global health)  President, The COVID- pandemic has shown us – yet again – that global problems require global solutions. It has also shown us what we can achieve together: effective vaccines developed in record time. We must not stop there:  We need to reform and strengthen the global health architecture to prevent, detect, and respond to future threats. And we need a fully financed WHO playing a central, coordinating role.  We must invest in health. We must build robust national health systems and ensure universal health coverage.  There is a glaring inequity in vaccine distribution. Some countries have vaccinated their populations, and are on the path to recovery. For others, the lack of vaccines and weak health systems pose a serious problem. In Africa, fewer than  in  people are fully vaccinated. In Europe, one in two are fully vaccinated. This inequity is clearly unfair. In some countries, the mindset seems to be that the pandemic is over – whilst others are facing huge waves of infection. The result is a disconnected world. It is unacceptable and dangerous. The truth is: The pandemic is not over, and it will not be over anywhere until it’s over everywhere. We need to accelerate the vaccination rollout across the world.  Norway is proud to co-chair the ACT-Accelerator. It was set up to promote equitable access to tests, treatments, and vaccines. Public-private partnerships such as CEPI and Gavi are also part of the solution. Let us all agree: Financing pandemic preparedness is a sound investment – and we all benefit from the returns.   We need to finance a sustainable recovery. We have an opportunity to do things right: We must align our efforts with our roadmap, the 2030 Agenda. We must invest in the green transition. We must invest in people, women and girls in particular. And we must fulfil the promise of the SDGs, to leave no one behind. We must secure the future welfare of a rapidly growing population. Domestic resource mobilisation is crucial to build back better and to reach the SDGs. Fair and effective tax systems are needed – not only to generate revenue, but also to build trust in government. The agreement reached in the OECD on a new framework for international tax reform is an important step forward.             NORWAY – Prime Minister – Mrs. Erna Solberg Without global trade and investments, we cannot solve the challenges we are facing. This will require job creation, openness, rules-based trade and fewer trade barriers. Free trade creates win-win solutions. Protectionism does not. (Peace and security, human rights)  President, Respect for human rights is essential to build prosperous and free societies. It is also the basis for equitable and stable societies. Everyone who believes in democracy must now defend its core values. On a personal note, I stand here as a Prime Minister who lost an election last week. After eight years, my Government will step down and hand over to a new team. I hope they will succeed in taking our country forward. I am mentioning this because orderly transitions cannot be taken for granted. And because democracy at work can help reduce the mistrust in and between countries. The kind of mistrust that the Secretary-General points to in ‘Our Common Agenda’.  The decline in democracy and respect for human rights should be of concern to us all. We are seeing grave human rights violations in many parts of the world. In Venezuela. The atrocities and conflict in Tigray.  The deteriorating humanitarian and human rights situation in Myanmar, including for the Rohingyas. To mention a few. We count on the Security Council and regional organisations to play a proactive role.  And we are alarmed and saddened by recent developments in Afghanistan. In the past two decades, Afghans have seen a significant progress in the human rights situation. Health care systems have been improved and millions of children have received an education. These hard-won gains must be protected.  We are now particularly concerned about the rights of women and girls, and people belonging to religious, ethnic, sexual and gender minorities.  We fear for those who are at risk because of their work to advance fundamental freedoms. We will continue to support them, and the rest of the Afghan people.  We will judge the Taliban by their actions, not but by their words. The composition of the interim government is discouraging. President, Global challenges have a major impact on international peace and security.  Twice this year, the Security Council has discussed the security implications of climate change. To reach the SDGs, conflict prevention, peacekeeping and disarmament are vital.                  NORWAY – Prime Minister – Mrs. Erna Solberg We must safeguard and strengthen the norms and structures that maintain peace. We must make sure that progress in this area is not reversed. We need to protect and promote the framework for nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation – first and foremost, the Non-Proliferation Treaty.  Great power rivalry can threaten strategic stability. Dialogue and cooperation are essential. The extension of the New START Treaty is a welcome step forward. The international norm against the use of weapons of mass destruction must be upheld.  The increased threat from chemical weapons must be countered. President, Durable peace is crucial to long-term security. In our work in the Security Council, we promote dialogue, partnerships, and preventive diplomacy.  To remain relevant, the Council must respond to threats to international peace and security. It must not shy away from challenging situations.  The adoption of the resolution extending the mandate for delivering cross-border humanitarian aid into Syria was encouraging. It offers hope of finding a political solution to the long-lasting conflict. UN peace operations play a key role throughout the world. Norway is a strong supporter of the Secretary-General’s Action for Peacekeeping initiative.  This includes financial support to enhance the capacity of UN peace operations to carry out their mandate. Especially their mandate to facilitate political processes, protect civilians and implement the women, peace, and security agenda.  Another challenge is maritime security and piracy. We need an integrated global response to make the oceans safe.  Some  % of piracy incidents take place in the Gulf of Guinea. Norway is seeking to advance this issue in the Security Council, in close cooperation with the countries in the region.  President, In closing, I would like to commend the Secretary-General for the realistic assessment he presents in ‘Our Common Agenda’. We are given a choice between breakdown and breakthrough. I remain optimistic.                    NORWAY – Prime Minister – Mrs. Erna Solberg We must take the crises we are now facing as our call to action. We must focus all there is to gain from acting together. There is a way forward. We have already charted our course; the 2030 agenda is our roadmap. Lets not hesitate. Let’s join forces and get started right away.  Thank you.     "
88,2021,SWE,Sweden, 
89,2021,GBR,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"President, Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen.     An inspection of the fossil record over the last 178 million years – since mammals first appeared – reveals that the average mammalian species exists for about a million years before it evolves into something else or vanishes into extinction.    Of our allotted lifespan of a million, humanity has been around for about 200,000.     In other words, we are still collectively a youngster.     If you imagine that million years as the lifespan of an individual human being – about eighty years – then we are now sweet .    We have come to that fateful age when we know roughly how to drive and we know how to unlock the drinks cabinet and to engage in all sorts of activity that is not only potentially embarrassing but also terminal.   In the words of the Oxford philosopher Toby Ord “we are just old enough to get ourselves into serious trouble”.                   We still cling with part of our minds to the infantile belief that the world was made for our gratification and pleasure      and we combine this narcissism with an assumption of our own immortality.   We believe that someone else will clear up the mess we make, because that is what someone else has always done.     We trash our habitats again and again with the inductive reasoning that we have got away with it so far, and therefore we will get away with it again.   My friends the adolescence of humanity is coming to an end.     We are approaching that critical turning point – in less than two months – when we must show that we are capable of learning, and maturing, and finally taking responsibility for the destruction we are inflicting, not just upon our planet but ourselves.   It is time for humanity to grow up.     It is time for us to listen to the warnings of the scientists – and look at Covid, if you want an example of gloomy scientists being proved right –     and to understand who we are and what we are doing.   The world – this precious blue sphere with its eggshell crust and wisp of an atmosphere – is not some indestructible toy,                     some bouncy plastic romper room against which we can hurl ourselves to our heart’s content.   Daily, weekly, we are doing such irreversible damage that long before a million years are up,     we will have made this beautiful planet effectively uninhabitable – not just for us but for many other species.   And that is why the Glasgow COP26 summit is the turning point for humanity.     We must limit the rise in temperatures – whose appalling effects were visible even this summer – to . degrees.    We must come together in a collective coming of age.     We must show we have the maturity and wisdom to act.     And we can.    Even in this feckless youth we have harnessed clean energy from wind and wave and sun.    We have released energy from within the atom itself   and from hydrogen, and we have found ways to store that energy in increasingly capacious batteries and even in molten salt.   We have the tools for a green industrial revolution                       but time is desperately short.   Two days ago in New York we had a session in which we heard from the leaders of the nations most threatened by climate change:   the Marshall Islands, the Maldives, Bangladesh and many others.    And they spoke of the hurricanes and the flooding and the fires caused by the extreme meteorological conditions the world is already seeing.   And the tragedy is that because of our past inaction   there are further rises in temperature that are already baked in – baked is the word.   And if we keep on the current track then the temperatures will go up by . degrees or more by the end of the century.    And never mind what that will do to the ice floes:    we will see desertification, drought, crop failure, and mass movements of humanity on a scale not seen before,   not because of some unforeseen natural event or disaster   but because of us,   because of what we are doing now.                            And our grandchildren will know that we are the culprits  and that we were warned  and they will know that it was this generation that came centre stage  to speak and act on behalf of posterity  and that we missed our cue  and they will ask what kind of people we were to be so selfish and so short sighted.    In just  days time we need the world to come to Glasgow     to make the commitments necessary.    And we are not talking about stopping the rise in temperatures -  it is alas too late for that -  but to restrain that growth, as I say, to . degrees.   And that means we need to pledge collectively to achieve carbon neutrality – net zero – by the middle of the century.   And that will be an amazing moment if we can do it    because it will mean that for the first time in centuries humanity is no longer                              adding to the budget of carbon in the atmosphere,    no longer thickening that invisible quilt that is warming the planet,   and it is fantastic that we now have countries    representing  per cent of the world’s GDP committed to this objective.   But if we are to stave off these hikes in temperature we must go further   and faster – we need all countries to step up and commit to very substantial reductions by 2030 -   and I passionately believe that we can do it by making commitments in four areas – coal, cars, cash and trees.   I am not one of those environmentalists who takes a moral pleasure in excoriating humanity for its excess.   I don’t see the green movement as a pretext for a wholesale assault on capitalism.   Far from it.     The whole experience of the Covid pandemic    is that the way to fix the problem is through science and innovation,                              the breakthroughs and the investment that are made possible by capitalism and by free markets,   and it is through our Promethean faith in new green technology that we are cutting emissions in the UK.    When I was a kid we produced almost  per cent of our electricity from coal;   that is now down to two per cent or less    and will be gone altogether by 2024.    We have put in great forests of beautiful wind turbines on the drowned prairies of Doggerland beneath the North Sea.    In fact we produce so much offshore wind that I am thinking of changing my name to Boreas Johnson in honour of the North Wind.    And I know that we are ambitious in asking the developing world to end the use of coal power by 2040   and for the developed world to do so by 2030,   but the experience of the UK shows that it can be done   and I thank President Xi for what he has done to end China’s international financing of coal and I hope China will now go further and phase out the domestic use of coal as well,                          because the experience of the UK shows it can be done.    And when I was elected mayor of London only  years ago,  I was desperate to encourage more electric vehicles  and we put in charging points around the city.   And I am afraid that in those days they were not greatly patronised.    But the market in EVs in the UK is now growing at an extraordinary pace -  maybe two thirds every year -  and Nissan is sufficiently confident to invest  billion in a new EV factory and a gigafactory for the batteries.     And that is because we have set a hard deadline for the sale of new hydrocarbon ICEs of 2030   and again we call on the world to come together to drive this market so that by 2040  there are only zero emission vehicles on sale anywhere in the world.    And you can make these cuts in pollution while driving jobs and growth:                             we have cut our greenhouse gas emissions by  per cent in the last  years   while expanding our GDP by  per cent.    And we will now go further by implementing one of the biggest nationally determined contributions -      the NDC is the pledge we ask every country to make in cutting carbon –    going down by  per cent by 2030, compared to where we were in 1990.   We are making a huge bet on hydrogen, we are expanding nuclear,    we are helping people to reduce their own household CO2.   We are working towards Jet Zero – the first large carbon free passenger plane.   And we also recognise that this is not just about using technical fixes for CO2:  we need to restore the natural balance,  we need to halt and reverse the loss of trees and biodiversity by 2030,  and that is why we in the UK are committed to beautifying the landscape,                           strengthening our protection against flooding,   by planting millions more trees.    We must also work towards the crucial Kunming summit in China  and I call on all nations to follow the example of Imran Khan   who has pledged to plant  billion trees in Pakistan alone.  And we in the developed world must recognise our obligation to help.   We started this industrial revolution in Britain:    we were the first to send the great puffs of acrid smoke to the heavens     on a scale to derange the natural order.    And though we were setting in train a new era of technology that was itself to lead to a massive global reduction in poverty,  emancipating billions around the world,  we were also unwittingly beginning to quilt the great tea cosy of CO2                              and so we understand when the developing world looks to us to help them   and we take our responsibilities.   And that’s why two years ago I committed that the UK would provide . billion to help the rest of the world to tackle climate change  and in spite of all the pressures on finances caused by Covid, we have kept that promise to the letter.   And I am so pleased and encouraged by some of the pledges we have heard here at UNGA, including from Denmark, and now a very substantial commitment from the US that brings us within touching distance of the $100 billion pledge.      But we must go further, and we must be clear that government alone will not be able to do enough   We must work together so that the international financial institutions – the IMF, the World Bank -  are working with governments around the world  to leverage in the private sector,   because it is the trillions of dollars of private sector cash that will enable developing nations – and the whole world – to make the changes necessary.                           It was the UK government that set the strike price for the private sector to come in and transform our country into the Saudi Arabia of wind,    and only yesterday the UK’s first sovereign green bond raised  billion on the markets,  from hard-headed investors who want to make money.   And these investments will not only help the countries of the world to tackle climate change:  they will produce millions and millions of high wage, high skill jobs,   and today’s workforce and the next generation will have the extra satisfaction of knowing that they are not only doing something useful -      such as providing clean energy - but helping to save the planet at the same time. And every day green start-ups are producing new ideas,  from feeding seaweed to cows to restrain their traditional signs of digestive approval,    to using AI and robotics to enhance food production.     And it is these technological breakthroughs that will cut the cost for consumers,                          so that we have nothing to fear and everything to gain from this green industrial revolution.   And when Kermit the frog sang It’s Not Easy Bein’ Green   I want you to know he was wrong - and he was also unnecessarily rude to Miss Piggy.   We have the technology:   we have the choice before us.   Sophocles is often quoted as saying that there are many terrifying things in the world, but none is more terrifying than man,  and it is certainly true that we are uniquely capable of our own destruction, and the destruction of everything around us.   But what Sophocles actually said was that man is deinos  and that means not just scary but awesome -  and he was right.  We are awesome in our power to change things  and awesome in our power to save ourselves, and in the next  days we must choose what kind of awesome we are going to be.                             I hope that COP  will be a 16th birthday for humanity in which we choose to grow up, to recognise the scale of the challenge we face, to do what posterity demands we must,  and I invite you in November to celebrate what I hope will be a coming of age and to blow out the candles of a world on fire.  See you in Glasgow. ENDS                  "
90,2021,ALB,Albania,"President of the General Assembly,  Mr. Secretary-General,  Distinguished delegates,  It is an immense pleasure to return,  physically, in this Great House of Peace, and be able to share our thoughts on the today’s world, including my country’s efforts and contribution in facing the biggest challenge of our time, the ongoing Covid- Pandemic,  which,  for more  that    months,  has  put  the  world  on  its  knees,  has inflicted terrible pain and caused untold suffering everywhere.  Like every other corner of the world, Albania has suffered from  this devastating scourge. From the very early days, we have followed all the recommendations of the World Health Organization; we have continuously and carefully implemented specific sanitary protocols in accordance with risk scenarios and the evolution of the situation; we have collaborated with our neighbours  in exchanging information and data, including on updated protocols of treatment and we will continue to do so. To this day, half of the Albanian population is vaccinated and we expect to have the whole recommended population fully vaccinated during the next  months.  Excellences,   One of the big lessons of this tragedy is that no country can face it alone; and we know now, no one will be safe until everyone is.  As we have seen  far too often, without cooperation, solidarity and joint actions, the price we pay, individually and collectively, will only be higher. This is why at the very heist of Covid crisis last year, dozens of Albanian doctors and nurses went to Italy to help their colleagues in the     Lombardy region; in return, we have been happy and grateful to welcome Italian Doctors assist us in the same fight home.   Let’s not forget: we will be able to prevail only through a common approach based on  deeper  solidarity,  continued  assistance,  and  uninterrupted  cooperation.  The sharp inequality to vaccine access – the only way to stop the virus - has once more highlighted  the  urgency  for  a  different  approach,  for  global leadership, inclusiveness, solidarity and fairness as well as trust to science.  This is why we have and continue to advocate in favour of enhanced international cooperation, and in this respect, we support the proposal for a new international treaty for pandemic preparedness and response: we must be and stay together, resist  to  any  temptation  of  isolationism  and  nationalism.  The  virus  knows  no borders, doesn’t stop at walls and is indifferent to nationalities. There is absolute urgency to radically improve vaccine access to all, as unvaccinated people carry the high risk to allow the emergence of more dangerous and deadly variants that could reverse  the  gains  so  painfully  made,  and  expose  us  all  to  even  more  dire consequences. If the  years long and strong experience of the UN has taught us anything,  it  is  that  challenges  to  peace,  development,  prosperity,  health  and security need the contribution of all, rich and poor, big and small.  Mr. President,   We firmly believe that,  years after its founding, the United Nations remain the cornerstone  of  the  multilateral  rule-based  world  order.  With  dialogue  and concerted efforts through the entire UN System, humanity has made remarkable      gains  in  peace,  security  and  development,  in  the  respect  of  human  rights  and human dignity; in empowering women and motivating youth, in helping hundreds of  millions  of  people  get  out  of  poverty.  We  must  continue  to  build  on  these achievements. The people, our citizens, are right to ask for more, for better and  faster, and we must be up to task.  Dear colleagues,  Let’s remind ourselves that the way we react and interact will determine our future. Today, multilateralism is challenged  when we know far too well where reclusion and nationalism has led the world more than once. Multilateralism can be slow, sometimes frustrating and it does not always produce quick results. But even for a second, a world without rules, obligations and multilateral institutions, is simply unimaginable. Therefore, we cannot afford to lose faith in the multilateral system. We must work to reform it; not undermine it, not abandon it.   We share UN Secretary General’s concerns in his report on “Our Common Agenda”, and  we  think  that  all  UN  member  states  have  the  responsibility  to  commonly contribute  to increasing  the  functionality  of  multilateral institutions  and mechanisms in order to make a tangible difference to people’s lives. It is exactly in this spirit that Albania successfully chaired the OSCE in 2020, as part of  its  continued  engagement  and  efforts  to  strengthen  peace,  human  rights, cooperation and equality in the OSCE area. The Ministerial Council of Tirana agreed on  several  new  commitments  on  combatting  transnational  organized  crime, countering corruption and preventing torture in the OSCE region.        It  is  with  the  same  faith  in  multilateral  institutions  and  with  an  unwavering commitment to international peace and security, that Albania is joining the Security Council of the United Nations, as a non-permanent member, for the term 2022-2023. I take this opportunity to  wholeheartedly  thank all UN member States for their overwhelming support and their trust. Albania will be a responsible, reliable and open member of the Council.  Albania will bring to the Security Council the perspective and contribution of a small but  active  country,  with  a  predictable  constructive  foreign  policy  vis  a  vis  its neighbours,  the  region  the  wider  Europe  and  beyond,  with  a  large  and  strong network of partners, with no conflicts with any of the members of the international community,  and,  let  me  repeat  it,  with  a  consistent  faithful  commitment  to multilateralism. Albania will bring its desire and true commitment for cooperation and  dialogue,  friendship  and  respect,  as  a  best  drive  towards  a  better  world,  a better life for all.   We will also bring with us a long and rich history of exemplary tolerance, openness to other cultures and nations, respect for differences. Whoever is seeking for a best practice in  placing respect for the different other at the heart of social cohesion that  stands  solid  against  intolerance  and  any  form  of  extremism,  may  turn  to Albania’s example.  As  a  confirmed  active  contributor  to  international  security,  we  will  sit  in  the Security Council with a clear agenda of priorities. They reflect what modern Albania stands for and range from the promotion of peace and security, peaceful conflict      resolution and mediation; the respect for the rule of law and the human rights for all;  increased  participation  of  women  and  youth  in  conflict  prevention  and resolution;  universal  adherence  and  full  implementation  of  all  non-proliferation and  disarmament  treaties  and  conventions;  concrete  and  continued  active committed to the fight against international terrorism, violent extremism.   Mr. President,  Climate Change is another key priority in our national agenda. We do not need to have repeated extreme weather events, catastrophic flooding and unbearable heat waves, to understand that the continued loss of biodiversity and the unsustainable use  and  degradation  of  ecosystems  are  causing  profound  and  adverse consequences to millions of people and threaten peace and security.  Convinced  of  the  urgency  to  curb  greenhouse  gas  emissions  in  line  with  Paris agreement and the 2030 Agenda, as of July 2019, the Government of Albania is the first  country  in  the  Region  with  an  endorsed  Strategy  on  Climate  Change  and related  Action  Plans,  with  policy  objectives  and  concrete  actions  to  reduce greenhouse  emissions.  A  special  law  on  “Climate  Change”  has  been  adopted  on December 2020. Further, in support of the objectives of the European Union Green Deal,  Albania  and  other  Western  Balkan  countries  signed  two  Declarations  in November 2020: the Western Balkan countries on the Green Agenda, as well as the creation  of  a  Common  Regional  Market,  which  aim  at  making  the  economy sustainable  and  climate-neutral  by  2050.  Albania  is  actively  engaged  in  doing  its part to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by % in the next decade, and to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.      Mr President,  Ladies and Gentlemen, The European integration process represents an anchor for Albania’s future and we look  forward  to  the  first  Intergovernmental  Conference  in  accordance  with  the decision  of  the  EU  Council  in  March  2020  to  open  accession  negotiations  with Albania. I have said in Tirana, in Brussels and I want to repeat it here: Albania is ready; we are waiting for the EU to do its part.  EU  integration  is  a  national  priority  goal;  it  is  a  region-wide  aspiration  and inspiration. In a totally and positively transformed regional context, all six Western Balkan Countries have agreed to enhance economic cooperation by developing  a Common Regional Market, based on the EU rules and standards. We have entered a  new  and  ambitious  phase  of  co-operation  and  are  working  to  concretely implement  the    EU  fundamental  freedoms:  freedom  of  movement  of  people, goods, services and capital, known as, as “Open Balkans”. It is the mark and proof of our regional ownership, convinced that it will generate economic growth, reduce unemployment,  increase  trade,  investment  and  employment  in  the  Western Balkan. Excellences,  The history of the United Nations is one of uninterrupted enlargement. It started with  members in San Francisco and we are now 193. But still this large Assembly      is not and will not be complete without one of the States of our region, the Republic of Kosovo.    You  have  heard  me  more  than  once  here  call  for  the  recognition  of  the independence  of  Kosovo.  It  is  not  an  obsession  nor  is  it  something  just  to  be mentioned;  it  is  an  invitation  to  acknowledge  the  new  realities  in  the  Balkans.  I want  to  reiterate  this  call  and  do  so  because  reality  has  shown,  to  us,  to  the Kosovars, to the Serbs, to all Europeans and to everyone anywhere who wants to see it, that an independent Kosovo – a reality already -years-strong - has brought peace and stability in the region, has helped move ahead from the bitter past, and is helping us all implement a common roadmap to our common future.  In  our  view,  there  is  no  alternative  to  dialogue  which  should  lead  to  mutual recognition  between  two  States,  two  neighbours.  Every  day  without  such  an agreement is a day lost, a day stolen to the youth in both countries, a day taken off the  common  future.  I  say  it  in  a  friendly  way  but  with  absolute  conviction:  only wisdom, courage and vision will finally liberate Serbia from the burden of its past.   Distinguished delegates, Before  concluding,  let  me  say  a  few  words  on  Afghanistan  and  the  worsening dramatic situation under the Taliban rule.   It  is  our  duty  to  do  whatever  possible  not  to  abandon  the  Afghans  who  find themselves  once  more in  the  cross-roads;  to  preserve  the  undeniable       achievements of the last two decades, prevent and resist to any return to the age of darkness we have seen before.  As the dramatic events were unfolding in front of our eyes, we could not stand idle. Despite limited capacities for reiving immigrants, but with a big heart, just as have done  in  other  critical  moments  of  our  history  in  saving  the  Jews  during  the Holocaust,  welcoming  half  a  million  of  our  Kosovo  brothers  in  1999,  we  have opened our doors and hearts to receive several thousand Afghan refugees.  We owe this to our moral constitution, to our duty to be in solidarity with those in danger in support of dignity and human life.  As the Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, the  Albanian Saint Mother Teresa once said: ""Even when you cannot do great things, do small things every day, but with great love.""  We are humbly doing our part. Thank you !   "
91,2021,BIH,Bosnia and Herzegovina,"President, Mr. Secretary General, Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen, The topic of this year’s debate addresses many current issues that truly present some of the key challenges to affect the future path we tread as a global society. The same is true for international and the  individual  politics  of  the  countries  we  come  from.  Our determination to  insist on  the common values  we  have chosen to protect  will  therefore  dictate  the  success  of  our  common aspirations. The COVID  pandemic was an important message and a lesson for  us  on  how  the  existing  international  system  can  be  easily shaken, but also how important the endurance and the resilience of international institutions built on multilateralism is for them to be able  to  respond  to  crisis  situations.  Suddenly,  international relations  were  threatened  while  human  rights  were  restricted. Multilateralism  seemed  to  have  collapsed.  The  gap  between  rich and developed countries on the one hand, and those less developed and not so rich on the other, has proven to be greater than ever in terms of access to medical equipment, medicines and vaccines. For the sake of social and economic recovery, the only thing left under those  circumstances  was  the  hope  for  the  resilience  of  national economies and health systems, as well as international institutions and bodies of the United Nations, in order to combat the pandemic and find and distribute vaccines. Still,  I  would  also  like  to  emphasize  the  importance  of  bilateral cooperation and assistance from neighboring or friendly countries, which in many regions, including my own, were the first concrete     aid and sign of solidarity before multilateral institutions responded to crises that was the COVID  pandemic. That gave us hope and showed the importance of good bilateral relations. It also justified investing  in  regional  cooperation  capacities.  I  would  now  like  to commend some of the numerous regional organizations from the Western  Balkans  that  have  helped  sustain  the  economy  and facilitate  the  flow  of  people  and  basic  goods  under  the  new circumstances. I am primarily referring to the Central European Free  Trade  Agreement  and  the  South  East  European  Regional Cooperation Council.  The pandemic has changed the world and affected the achievement of the sustainable development goals. Under the influence of new circumstances,  the  SDGs  need  to  be  seen  in  a  whole  new  light. However, one of the most important issues of today, closely related to the goals of sustainable development as a need of global society, is finding answers to the needs of the planet.  Climate change and global warming, both visible and scientifically proven  through  the  work  of  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on Climate  Change,  are  key  issues  that  also  limit  the  course  of sustainable  development.  Our  activities  to  slow  global  warming and combat climate change are generally not yielding the results we  need  to  achieve  by  2050,  warns  the  2018  special  report.  This year’s  report  repeats  the  same  warning.  Climate  change  is  no longer a matter of warnings from the scientific community. It is a crisis situation that is already upon us. Finding answers to climate change is a costly process. It will cost even more if we do not take the  need  to  accelerate  climate  change  mitigation  activities seriously.  We  have  taken  on  that  commitment  because  the humankind  survival  scenario,  along  with  mitigating the temperature rise, is a value that we must defend at all costs. We did not choose that value. It chose us. I believe that in the long run, this necessary response will cost the lessdeveloped  and  developing  countries  the  most  -  the  countries which still rely on energy derived from fossil fuels. As a rule, those   groups of countries do not have sufficient capacity or resources to make  a  rapid  and  equitable  transition  to  green  energy  sources. That  will  affect  their  ability  to  achieve  sustainable  development goals  in  the  medium  term.  Therefore,  financial  support  for  the implementation of the Green Agenda is extremely important, with contributions from the Conference of Parties of the United Nations Climate Change Conference as well as regional associations such as  the  European  Union.  In  addition  to  the  existing  obligations under  the  Paris  Agreement,  the  EU  also  establishes  additional standards accepted by countries such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, in the process of stabilization and association with the European Union.  In  my  country,  Bosnia  and  Herzegovina,  we  have  about % of green capacity for electricity generation. However, gradual shutdown  of  thermal  power  plants,  and  thus  most  of  the  mines, which is expected of us in the next - years, will cause a shortage of electricity that can hardly be replaced in timely fashion by the green  energy  capacity,  while  preserving  rivers  and  ecological biodiversity,  in  accordance  with  international  norms.  Those  are some  of  the  real  circumstances  and  challenges  that  we  face.  I believe  that  many  other  states  present  here  face  those  as  well. However,  Bosnia  and  Herzegovina  stands  behind  its  promise  to contribute to reduction of GHG emissions.  Mr.President, in  sustainable One  of  the  consequences  of  the  slowdown development that we are facing is the outflow of the working age population  to  developed  countries.  According  to  available statistics, almost % of the population has emigrated from Bosnia and  Herzegovina  since  the  last  census.  Mostly,  the  working  age population. Young families with children. That is why I would like to  draw  attention  to  the  fact  that,  in  addition  to  the  well-known wave of economic migrants from the Asian Middle East and North Africa,  which  my  country  has  faced  and  tried  to  provide humanitarian aid, food and accommodation for, we are also facing    an  outflow  of  population.  That  will  cause  additional  social problems to our society. Our people are leaving in search of better business and life opportunities, but also seeking security in orderly societies based on the active promotion and protection of human rights  values.  They  go  after  the  perspective  of  living  in  an environment where their knowledge and work can create for them a life in the certainty of a rational social order. It is for this reason that I emphasize the protection of human rights as  the  next  great  value.  That  is  a  value  that  we  have  decided  to establish already with the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In Europe, we also have the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, implemented under the auspices of the Council of Europe. In the European  Union,  the  Charter  of  Fundamental  Rights  of  the European Union came into effect in 2009. Recently, however, human rights values seem to have been shaken, applied  selectively,  and  approached  on  the  basis  of  double standards.  I  consider  such  tendencies  very  dangerous  for  the preservation of the human rights protection system. The  strengthening  of  ethnic  politics  in  my  country,  based  on exclusivity and ethno-chauvinist tendencies, along with the rise of religious intolerance and the collapse of secularism in the Western Balkans region, is a matter of great concern. Given the 1992-1995 war  they  have  been  through,  the  citizens  of  Bosnia  and Herzegovina  are  very  sensitive  to  such  social  disturbances. Especially  because  of  the  genocide  committed  in  Srebrenica,  as determined by the verdict of the International Court of Justice in The Hague and confirmed by the judgments of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). I  would  like  to  emphasize  here,  before  you,  that  I  come  from  a country considered a successful example of peace-building, but also of maintaining peace and developing institutions in the context of the  United  Nations  mandate.  The  Constitution  of  Bosnia  and   Herzegovina is part of an international peace agreement known as the  Dayton  Peace  Agreement.  The  United  Nations  Universal Declaration  of  Human  Rights  and  the  European  Convention  for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms are also  integral  parts  of  our  Constitution.  Still,  during  the  last  few years, our society has been under increasing pressure of attempts to  degrade  basic  human  and  civil  rights  and  eliminate  the individual, the citizen, as a subject of human rights. The complex system  of  institutions  of  Bosnia  and  Herzegovina  based  on  the Dayton  Peace  Agreement  makes  it  difficult  to  reach  a  political consensus to move my country from the Dayton Peace Agreement that  stopped  the  war  to  a  functioning  state  with  the  prospect  of becoming a member of the European Union and NATO in a way that accepts all the values required by democracy, the rule of law and the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.  Mr. President, To  point  out  the  selectivity  in  the  application  of  international human  rights  instruments,  I  would  like  to  reflect  on  this  very important segment of human rights protection from the point  of view of the country I come from. I believe that we all share the view that the protection of human rights in all segments of society is one of the necessary conditions for the creation of stable democracies, in which peace and prosperity will prevail. However, if we consider that  through  the  prism  of  the  political  system  of  Bosnia  and Herzegovina,  the  country  I  come  from,  I  would  like  to  take  this opportunity  to  share  with  all  of  you  a  few  important  elements, which are unfortunately a part of the other,  negative side of this story. The General Framework Agreement for Peace, initialed in Dayton and signed in Paris in 1995, is in force in Bosnia and Herzegovina. An integral part of the Agreement, as Annex , is the Constitution of  Bosnia  and  Herzegovina.  In  its  preamble,  it  clearly  and    unequivocally  states  that  it  is,  among  other  things,  based  on  the Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights  of  1948.  It  is  clear  that accession to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights does not impose a direct legal obligation on the acceding countries. But, it is certainly  a  system  of  values,  which,  among  other  things,  aims  to create a society within the countries themselves, but also beyond, based on the equality of every human being on the planet in their basic human rights. Unfortunately, such system of values, based on the equality of all individuals  within  a  society,  does  not  exist  in  Bosnia  and Herzegovina.  I  further  argue  that  an international  court, specifically the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, in its five judgments against Bosnia and Herzegovina, established the existence of systemic discrimination or systemic inequality of the citizens of my country. Such inequality is reflected in several aspects of life. That includes political aspects because all citizens do not have equal rights in the electoral system, but also those where the  same  citizens  do  not  have  equal  rights  and  opportunities  in social life, such as the right to work. The political system in Bosnia and  Herzegovina  is  such  that  it  gives  preference  to  someone’s ethnicity. Based on that ethnicity, the citizens of my country have greater  or  lesser  rights,  depending  on  which  part  of  the  country they live in. On this occasion, I would like to remind everyone that discrimination based on a person’s ethnic origin is one of the forms of racial discrimination as set out in Item  of the Article  of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination adopted by the United Nations in 1966. The complexity of this issue is evident in the attempts to impose on us,  even  through  diplomatic activities  on  the international  scene, the  existence  of  discrimination  and  inequality  of  the  citizens  of Bosnia and Herzegovina. That is done by emphasizing the ethnicity of a part of the citizens and demands for greater rights for ethnic communities  supported  by  neighboring  countries,  always  to  the detriment of fundamental human rights. This means that collective   rights,  which  are  not  part  of  international  legal  acts,  are  being placed above the human rights of individuals. Please allow me to state that such things are unacceptable at this moment in time. Furthermore,  diplomatic  activities  of  various  actors  call  for additional discrimination on ethnic grounds, in order to create an atmosphere for a process of self-determination within those ethnic communities. The ultimate goal is the dissolution or disintegration of  Bosnia  and  Herzegovina  and  the  annexation  of  parts  of  its territory to neighboring countries. That encourages inequality in human rights, completely devaluing and ignoring the provisions of the  Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights.  Those  same  factors completely  negate  the  judgments  of  the  International  Criminal Tribunal  for  the  Former  Yugoslavia.  The  judgments  of  the Tribunal  stated  genocide,  crimes  against  humanity,  war  crimes, ethnic cleansing and even the existence of joint criminal enterprises where it was further established that all those most heinous crimes were committed on the basis of different ethnicities of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina. That negates one of the fundamental human rights according to the Universal Declaration, which is the right to life. Awards are given to the glorified war criminals, without any moral dilemmas. I consider that to be in direct contradiction with another value of the United Nations, which is the elimination of impunity for war crimes. That raises another question requiring a very clear answer - how to deal with the factors negating the courts formed by the United Nations? How to treat them in specific cases of denial of verdicts convicting the perpetrators of the crimes of genocide, crimes  against  humanity,  war  crimes  and  ethnic  cleansing?  Can such factors, which deny those verdicts and hide the perpetrators of genocide and war crimes, even be a part of the international legal order?  That  question  directly  goes  back  to  the  foundations  of international law and the United Nations organization itself. At  the  same  time,  the  principles  of  universal  jurisdiction  are abused for political purposes, outside of the prescribed procedures   and agreements concluded between the states that clearly specify the modalities of persecution of war crime suspects who inevitably must  be  held  accountable.  Those  war  crime  suspects  have citizenships of the countries which hold the primary responsibility for this. If universal jurisdiction is used in a selective and political way, that deeply compromises the principles of criminal law and legal  security,  and  thus  human  rights.  It  also  undermines confidence in judicial mechanisms. On  the  other  hand,  certain  politics,  by  means  of  forcing discrimination  and  inequality  of  the  citizens  of  Bosnia  and Herzegovina, attempt to invade the constitutional and legal system of my country, in order to get a “Golden Key” or “Golden Share” in managing and making decisions in the country. Under all acts of international law, such as the Charter of the United Nations, they should not be allowed to do so. Their tendencies in the diplomatic field, where they deny the fundamental human rights of individuals in order to achieve their clear goals by means of certain imaginary collective  rights,  go  beyond  good  neighborly  relations.  Such activities  and  intentions  hide  the  strategic  goal  of  appropriating parts of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  towards All  those  tendencies  are  based  on  the  visible  neglect  of  human rights  established  by  a  number  of  international  acts,  such  as  the Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights.  Their  politically dangerous  goals  are  very  much  behind  all  this,  leading  to  daily destabilization of the region of the Western Balkans. Such political goals  are  directed territory  of  Bosnia  and Herzegovina.  That  is  evident  in  their  efforts  to  force  inequality among citizens on the basis of ethnicity, which, to remind you once again, is a form of racial discrimination, and the efforts to create ethnically pure territorial units. I am telling you all this to show on real examples of how the neglect of human rights and creating an enviroment  of  inequality  among  citizens,  individuals,  can  have political agendas, which lead to destabilization of entire regions in the world, such as the Western Balkans. Apart from the fact that the   something  like  this  is  completely  unacceptable,  it  is  also  very dangerous. Mr. President, Distinguished colleagues, I  mention  this  situation  in  my  country  in  the  context  of  the importance of the mechanisms of the United Nations. By means of two  resolutions,  the  UN  established  the  institution  of  the  United Nations High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, to take care of the implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement. Thus the  obligation  of  the  United  Nations  itself  to  protect  the international order, through the protection of acts of international law.  One  of  those  acts  is  the  Universal  Declaration  of  Human Rights. Therefore, I believe that this is the right place to emphasize the  expectation  that  the  new  High  Representative  of  the international community in Bosnia and Herzegovina will take into account  the  need  to  protect  international  legal  acts  and  their fundamental  values.  That  is  one  of  his  most  important  tasks. Otherwise,  if  the  international  community  itself  in  Bosnia  and Herzegovina  wants  to  abandon  the  implementation  of  the Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights,  then  the  following question rightly arises - is the Universal Declaration even necessary if  its  implementation  is  selective?  Should  we  even  talk  about  the protection  of  human  rights  in  general  if,  in  the  specific  case  of Bosnia  and  Herzegovina,  where  the  United  Nations  still  has  an executive mandate through the Office of the High Representative, we do not show by example that we are ready to stand for common values  such  as  protection  of  human  rights  and  equality  of  every citizen in relation to someone else and different. I  believe  that, despite  all  the  differences  of political  views  within Bosnia  and  Herzegovina,  including  the  international  community represented by the Peace Implementation  Council  in BiH,  which assists  the High  Representative, the  only  guiding  light  to  further    political  development  of  my  country,  as  a  pledge  to  preserve  its peace and future, must be respect for human rights values. All the people  of  my  country,  regardless  of  their  identity,  ethnicity, religious affiliation or absence thereof, must have the same rights. Otherwise,  we  will  end  up  in  an  “Orwellian  society”,  where  it  is accepted that some are, after all, more important than others. That always jeopardizes the stability of a society and undermines peace and security. From this very place, I call upon the United Nations institutions  to  insist  on  the  values  of  human  rights  protection  in every segment of their activities.  Mr. President, Finally, I  would like to  express my support for  the efforts of the Secretary-General, who, with the help of his services and the UN agencies, has managed to preserve the role of the United Nations in these  difficult  circumstances  of  the  pandemic.  Also  to  you, President, for your effort this year to provide a live opportunity to exchange views on current world problems reflecting also on our social activities in the countries we come from. I  believe  we  will  next  year  have  a  General  Debate  under  better epidemiological  circumstances.  That  certainly  requires  us  to promote  the  necessity  of  vaccination  as  the  only  scientifically proven way to avoid fatal consequences for human health, but also severe economic consequences for the society. Thank you        "
92,2021,HRV,Croatia,"President of the Republic of Croatia 76th Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, General Debate September , 2021, New York Mr. President, Excellencies,  Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great honour to address this important body once again. I especially want to congratulate you, Mr. President, on being elected to preside over the 76th Session. I wish you much success. I also want to thank your predecessor, H.E. Volkan Bozkir of Turkey, for his leadership and guidance in truly difficult times. And I congratulate H.E. Antnio Guterres on his re-appointment as UN Secretary-General.  Perhaps more than ever, it is important we continue to strengthen multilateralism and the international rules-based order, with the United Nations playing a central role. Mr. President, You are right in pointing out how this moment in history calls for, above all, hope.  Violence, poverty and hunger are once again on the rise. Our post-pandemic recovery will be even more hard pressed in upending the world’s uneven economic development. Devastating natural disasters, especially due to severe weather patterns, are increasingly more difficult to deal with. And as our best scientific minds tell us, we can no longer afford to ignore how climate change is making natural hazards worse. Migration continues to rise, further fuelling discontent in its wake. All along, populists and disinformation campaigns, blatantly or maliciously ignoring factual accounts, can unnervingly shake people’s confidence in public authorities, in science and in the media.    But we cannot, we must not give in. It is our responsibility, as global leaders, to tackle these false narratives head on; to win back the people’s trust; to give them hope. Multilateralism, global solidarity and international cooperation have little, if any, alternatives. It is a sound way forward for rational beings. The United Nations stands only to benefit from its cooperation with regional multilateral actors like, in a European context, the EU, the Council of Europe, the OSCE and NATO. I therefore want to reemphasize Croatia’s commitment to our collective efforts in tackling the many challenges before us. This includes taking action on climate change, our commitment to solidarity in times of crises, protecting human rights and upholding humanitarian law, promoting education and the empowerment of women, peaceful conflict resolution, fighting organized crime and corruption, countering terrorism, and dealing with disruptive technologies. Mr. President, The COVID- pandemic is a historic test for our generation. How we respond today, both individually and collectively, will greatly shape the world of generations to come.  Croatia is pleased to have been able to co-coordinate, with Afghanistan, the resolution on the “Comprehensive and coordinated response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-) pandemic”, which not only set the stage for our recovery, but also for building back better. The resolution also recognizes the value of an integrated “One Health approach”. By better understanding the health related interlinkages of humans, animals and our ecosystem, we stand a better chance at tackling antimicrobial resistance, as well as preventing and containing another major zoonotic disease outbreak. I think we all share in the aspirations of a comprehensive, multi-sectoral engagement in strengthening national, regional and global capacities, as well as society’s overall resilience to a future pandemic.  Let us maintain momentum and keep working towards a more robust architecture that will reinforce global health security. The World Health Organization plays a pivotal role, and therefore, its further development is essential. Establishing legal standards and assuring compliance is a fundamental part of an effective multilateral cooperative response. This is why Croatia actively advocates the “Pandemic Preparedness and Response Agreement”. As an upcoming member of ECOSOC (2022-2024), Croatia wants to foster the deliverance of a stronger multilateral response to the pandemic, in the spirit of global solidarity and partnership. Safe and effective vaccines, as well as diagnostics and treatment, need to be made more easily accessible to all, in a timely and sustainable way, and without discrimination.  We are firmly committed to supporting the work of ECOSOC as the UN’s key platform for implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, clearing our path to recovery.  Mr. President,  Ahead of the 26th UN Climate Change Conference (COP ) in Glasgow this November, it is vital we stay on track and promote the continuous implementation of the Paris Agreement. Even Pope Francis, who has dedicated his first Encyclical Laudato Si’ to the common heritage of our Planet, is expected to attend. The necessary changes in our lives and in our economies will certainly not be easy. However, I am convinced that shifting to green and sustainable technologies can go hand-in-hand with economic growth. Croatia is actively setting up a legislative and strategic framework, which is a prerequisite for coordinated action on climate change. Our commitment to reaching climate neutrality is visible through several key strategic achievements: the National Development Strategy 2030, the Strategy of Low-Carbon Development 2030 with a view to 2050, and the Five-Year Action Plan for the implementation of a Strategy of low-carbon development.  Let me say a few words about our southeast neighbourhood. Croatia has vested interests in the well-being of the Western Balkans. The region’s stability, functionality and prosperity means a great deal to us. This is why Croatia is one of the strongest advocates of the region’s EU enlargement prospects. The fulfilment of well-established criteria, the implementation of reforms and delivering tangible results remain key requirements for EU membership. But even more so, the path to membership serves to secure the higher standards its peoples aspire to. Democratic transformation and the rule of law will remain central markers. But we have also continued to call on all regional leaders to lower tensions, overcome their differences, and seek ways to build lasting relationships. In a way, Bosnia and Herzegovina is a cornerstone of peace and security in the wider region. Its territorial integrity, functioning institutions, and inter-ethnic cohabitation have always been important concerns for Croatia. Yet, the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina is as challenging and as complex as it gets in the Western Balkans. (And it is always challenging in the Western Balkans) We would like to see a stable, peaceful and prosperous Bosnia and Herzegovina, progressing firmly on the path to EU membership; a country where the equality among its three constituent peoples and the rights of all its citizens are fully guaranteed. Unfortunately, narratives in Bosnia and Herzegovina often swing between two tenaciously unachievable and unjust ends – centralised governance and separatism. In their own way, both are destructive and contrary to the spirit of its constitutional framework, stemming from the Dayton-Paris Agreement. The Dayton-Paris Agreement is not without its faults, which undoubtedly will need to be addressed. However, we should not underestimate Bosnia and Herzegovina’s well-established sensitivities and inherited intricacies. Nor should it be subject to experimentation that dangerously deviate from the Dayton-Paris Agreement’s founding principles. This is essential  in moving Bosnia and Herzegovina forward and securing its EU aspirations. The inequality of its constituent peoples has been left unresolved for too long. It unnecessarily created internal political instabilities and tensions. In order to move forward, Bosnia and Herzegovina requires an appropriate institutional ‘power sharing’ framework, based on principles of federalism, decentralisation and legitimate representation. The concept of constituent peoples is often mispresented as an obstacle to the equal rights of all its citizens. Many political and legal practices can be ensured without having to give up democratic rights and freedoms. Bosnia and Herzegovina’s electoral reforms are long overdue and urgently needed. Electoral reforms should facilitate constituent peoples (Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats) are able to respectively choose their representatives at all the appropriate political levels. Bosnia and Herzegovina’s Croats have not been able to exercise this right. It’s no wonder they feel marginalized and disenfranchised. This has to change. Mr. President, The collapse of Afghanistan’s Government is a major setback. After  years of our engagement and investments, it is hard not to come away discouraged. We will certainly assess the lessons from our Afghan experience. But the key question today is how should we deal with the Taliban? Maintaining a pragmatic approach will not be easy, as we rightfully call upon those in power to respect the most fundamental rights of their people. Security will remain fragile, as risks of a regional spillover cannot be ruled out. We are also concerned Afghanistan may once again become a breeding ground for terrorism. Croatia has decided to financially support UN OCHA’s efforts in providing humanitarian support to the Afghan people. The Middle East Peace Process remains crucial not just regionally but globally. We call on both sides to refrain from unilateral actions that could exacerbate tensions and reopen new cycles of violence. In the long  term, the focus should be on developing a wider political horizon for meaningful negotiations and renewing the peace process. A two state solution based on internationally agreed upon parameters remains viable. Reviving the Iran nuclear deal is a key instrument of regional security and stability that can still serve as a useful platform for broader regional dialogue. We hope that further diplomatic efforts will contribute to resolving issues of common interest. After over a decade of instability, the Libyan crisis could be winding down. Nevertheless, a lasting peace will remain complicated. I sincerely hope the planned elections will be held in December, as a legitimate leadership is an important precondition for a successful transition. Mr. President,  Together, we urgently need to start reforming the UN, especially the Security Council, our main instrument for securing global peace and security. In this regard, we welcome the Secretary General’s efforts, expressed in his recently published report - “Our Common Agenda.” Croatia also upholds the “Responsibility to Protect”, consensually adopted in the 2005 World Summit Outcome. We welcomed the General Assembly’s resolution on the “Responsibility to Protect (R2P) and the prevention of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity”, adopted in this Assembly with overwhelming support. Together with Costa Rica, Denmark and the Global Centre for “Responsibility to Protect”, Croatia organized yesterday’s special event on protecting women and girls, directly affected and often targeted in conflict and post-conflict settings. Croatia reaffirms its strong commitment to a rules-based international order and to uphold international law, two essential ingredients of peaceful coexistence and cooperation among states. We support the role of the International Criminal Court and call upon those member states yet to ratify the Rome Statute, to do so. Promoting the rights of women and children, confronting hate speech, calling for an abolition of the death penalty, protecting minorities and  actively promoting ‘casualty recording’ and the mandate on truth, justice and reparations are among our human rights priorities at the UN. Croatia is still searching for ,858 of its own citizens that are still missing or unaccounted for from our 1991-1995 Homeland War. It is a lasting painful burden for the affected families, not to mention the toll on our society’s desire to move on. That the fate of the missing is unknown some thirty years later is especially excruciating. We urge other neighbouring states to cooperate in good faith and to respect their declared commitments and international agreements. I confess that I cannot understand the lack of information sharing and access to archival leads on the possible locations of individual and mass graves, so many years after the conflict. Mr. President, It is impossible not to recall the horrific terrorist attacks of /, twenty years ago. Terrorism continues to be our era’s formidable security threat. On the other hand, it has also ushered in unprecedented cooperation on, and unwavering resolve to counter terrorism.  Cyber security is perhaps one of our fastest growing concerns. Trends appear to indicate an increasing diversification of malicious efforts, perhaps state-sponsored ones being the most worrisome. Particularly upsetting incidents involve cyber-attacks targeting our critical health infrastructures, already exhausted in the struggle with the COVID- pandemic. Croatia is proud to have contributed to  UN peacekeeping operations. We also aspire to join the UN Peacebuilding Commission and continue our engagement from previous mandates. Nuclear weapons and the corresponding technology still loom large in the security calculus of leading global powers. Nightmare scenarios can greatly be avoided by sincere commitments to the nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT), a foundation of global nuclear order. We hope to see progress in the NPT’s review conference.  But while nuclear weapons cast large shadows, let us not lose sight of lingering threats posed by illicit small arms and light weapons trafficking. We know this first hand from the armed conflicts and organized crime activity in the Western Balkans. We will continue advocating for effective multilateral action on tackling illegal arms transfers and build-ups. Thank you.   "
93,2021,GRC,Greece,"President, Mr. Secretary General, Head of States and Governments, Excellencies, Mesdames et Messieurs, Ladies and Gentlemen, For nearly two years the world has been grappling with one of the greatest challenges we have faced in modern times. The impact of COVID- is an ever-present reminder of the realities we continue to face in the battle against this pandemic.  But as we gather here this week, I believe that, in spite of the pain and disruption brought about by this terrible disease, there are reasons to be optimistic. If these events have taught us anything, then it is this: that hope is born of co-operation.  For the first time in human history our planet joined hands and delivered a collective scientific miracle.  The discovery, development, and production of not just one but several safe and effective vaccines, in a very short period of time. What in the past took us decades, was now achieved in months. And Europe led the way on numerous fronts.          We led the way on vaccine procurement. Vaccines were purchased by the EU  and  distributed  to  all  member  states  based  on  their  population, regardless of size and economic might. A true act of solidarity.  We  led  the  way  on  vaccine  donation  to  countries  outside  the  EU:  in Greece's  case  . million  doses  so far,  with   million more to  come,  to countries ranging from  Iraq  to Rwanda  and from  Libya to  Jordan. Also, 510.000 doses through the COVAX Facility. We  agreed,  last  July  on  an  unprecedented  EU  wide  fiscal  stimulus package, Next Generation EU, that is now driving a sustained economic recovery across the continent. And  we  agreed  on  the  development  of  the  EU  Digital  certificate.  An innovative  concept  that  Greece  proposed,  the  implementation  of  which has been central to the restoration of our freedoms, the support of tourism and the rejuvenation of our economies.  And  as  we  stand  here  today  –  less  than  six  weeks  from  the  COP   conference in Glasgow – we continue to talk about the other great issue of  our  time,  climate,  with  renewed  sense  of  urgency.  The  question  is whether we are capable of aligning our flowery rhetoric with the necessary action to avert a catastrophe of unimaginable consequences.             Let  me  be  clear.  This  is  no  longer  about  climate  change.  This  is  about addressing a climate crisis.  Our collective response to COVID crossed borders and proved that, when the world needed to stand-up and stand-together, it could confront truly global  issues.  Our collective  response  to the climate  crisis must  do  the same.  Ladies and Gentlemen, Scientists  tell  us  that  the  Mediterranean  ecosystem,  which  is  home  to some of the world’s most ancient civilizations, is particularly susceptible to the consequences of rising temperatures. And of course, Greece is not immune. This summer we paid a heavy price as  unprecedented mega wildfires  ravaged my country. And yet,  help  to fight the fires came from across Europe and beyond. I am deeply grateful to  the    countries  that  sent  us  support  to  help  us  tame  a  natural phenomenon of ferocious intensity. I am very pleased that last Friday, alongside Greece, the leaders of  other Mediterranean countries made the climate crisis the focal point of the 8th annual EUMED summit in Athens.             The  Athens  Declaration,  adopted  by  Portugal,  Spain,  France,  Italy, Croatia, Cyprus, Malta, Slovenia,  and  Greece,  focuses  on key areas  of the climate crisis with particular relevance to the Mediterranean, including biodiversity,  forest  management;  the  marine  environment;  and  civil protection, prevention and preparedness.  My  country’s  commitment  to  addressing  the  climate  crisis  is  unwavering and it transcends all aspects of public policy.   years ago, before COVID struck, I announced from this very podium that Greece would shut down all its lignite (that is brown coal) fired electricity production  plants  by  2028.  Now  we  are  working  to  bring  this  date  even sooner, to 2025. We are investing  billion of European and national funds to support the Green transition. We are addressing the issue of plastics pollution on land and at sea. We intend to protect our marine environment by designating % of our seas as no-catch zones by 2030. We are also implementing ambitious plans, in partnership with the private sector,  to  accelerate  the  use  of  green  energy  in  our  most  sensitive ecosystems.  For  example,  on  Astypalaia  in  the  Dodecanese,  we  have  begun  a  long-term  project  alongside  Volkswagen  to  develop  Europe's  first  fully  green island.  And  Greece  is  leading  a  global  initiative  that  aims  to  accelerate action to protect cultural and natural heritage from the impacts of climate.           Ladies and gentlemen,  Let me turn now to the escalating complexity of international relations and our continued efforts to consolidate regional peace & security.   Since our last meeting and United Nations General Assembly, the Eastern Mediterranean has seen more days of instability than calmness.   While  it  is  true  there  are  diverging  views  between  Greece  and  our  near neighbor  Turkey,  Greece  has  always  been  committed  to  the  rules  and principles of international law and remains a strong advocate that disputes need to be settled peacefully, in accordance with the UN Charter.  Let me point out that it is the UN Charter which bans the use or the threat of force. However, since 1995 Greece has been facing a formal, regularly renewed and clearly illegal and unacceptable threat of the use of force by Turkey.   Furthermore,  given  that  Greece is a maritime country  made  up  of many thousands  of  islands  and  a  coastline  that  stretches  for  more  than   thousand  kilometers,  the  longest  in  the  Mediterranean,  and  as  a  global maritime power, we are fully committed to the Law of the Sea, as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas.              We  have  recently  signed,  after  many  years  of  negotiations,  delimitation agreements  on  our  maritime  zones  with  Italy  and  Egypt,  and  we  have agreed  with  Albania  to  refer  delimitation  to  the  International  Court  of Justice. This,  I  believe,  is  the  best  proof  that  disputes  regarding  maritime delimitations, no matter how complex and longstanding, can be resolved, provided we agree on a common rule book. And the only rulebook available is the that of international law of the seas. It  is  that  mindset  that  defines  our  approach  to  Turkey.  We  have  always supported  the  need  for  open  channels  of  communication  and  for cooperation between our two neighboring countries. What happened last year, when Ankara raised tensions, unnecessarily and without provocation, threatening confrontation between two NATO Allies, must not be repeated. Turkey  should  understand  that  its  aggressive  attitude  in  this  respect, undermines  prospects for  a  mutually  beneficial  relationship,  and jeopardizes  regional  security  and  stability.  More  than  this,  it  makes Turkey’s relationship with Europe more complicated.   Let me be absolutely clear. We will continue to protect our sovereignty and our  sovereign  rights  across  our  territory,  on  land,  at  sea,  and  in  our airspace. At the same time, I will spare no effort to continue reaching out to Turkey to explore avenues of cooperation.            I  have  a  vision  for  the  Eastern  Mediterranean:  instead  of  fighting  last century’s  battles  over  hydrocarbons  – a fading commodity  –  we  have to join forces and cooperate against new common enemies.  Τhe climate crisis, which affects both our countries equally. But also, the threat of illegal migration, where Turkey has an important role to play in cooperating with us to eradicate the networks of illegal smugglers that prey on the desperation of vulnerable people.  There is much our two countries can do together. We are bound by history and geography to coexist. It is in our common interest to do so peacefully and prosperously. Ladies and gentlemen,  Where I am less optimistic is on the issue of Cyprus. It is regrettable that Turkey continues to ignore a series of UN Resolutions, amongst them 541 and 550, and insists on the militarization of the island. It  continues  its  illegal  violation  of  Cyprus’  maritime  zones  and  airspace and violates UN resolutions on the fenced area of Varosha.                Greece  remains  fully  committed  to  supporting  efforts  led  by  the  UN Secretary General for the resumption – as soon as possible – of result-oriented negotiations for a viable solution of the Cyprus Issue.   And that solution can only be found on the basis of the UNSC Resolutions, which call for a mutually acceptable settlement of a bizonal, bicommunal federation,  with  political  equality,  a  single  sovereignty,  a  single international  personality,  and  a  single  citizenship.  Any  talk  regarding  a two-state solution is simply unacceptable.  In  our  immediate  neighborhood,  Libya  continues  to  suffer  from  the devastating effects of a decade long civil war. The Libyan people deserve a peaceful future, where their destiny is in their own hands, free from the presence of foreign troops, mercenaries, and foreign fighters.  Libyans want the right to freely elect their own government, without foreign intervention.  We  stand  by  them.  And  we  support  their  demand  for  the withdrawal  of  all  foreign  forces  and  for  the  holding  of  free  elections  on December  24th,  2021.  And  we  appreciate  the  work  done  by  the  United Nations and Special Envoy Jan Kubis.  I also want to briefly address the issue of the Western Balkans. Greece has always been an active supporter of greater European integration as a vehicle for a more prosperous, stable and democratic future for the region.            Ever since the  adoption  of  “The Thessaloniki  agenda”  in  2003,  that  EU perspective has been the driving force for reform, democratization, and change. But there has also been fatigue and disappointment.  years is a long time. In  a  matter  of  days,  the  EU-Western  Balkans  Summit  takes  place  in Slovenia. Let us not miss the opportunity to use that Summit to take a bold step forward. It is time for the EU to deliver. Ladies and gentlemen, Greece  believes  in  a  multilateral  approach  to  the  complex  global challenges of today. But I am also a firm believer in the absolute necessity of Europe's strategic autonomy.  Recent events have clearly demonstrated that we must be both willing and able to do more on our own. This should not come at the expense of our transatlantic bonds.   If anything, a European Defense Union will strengthen NATO. It will oblige European  countries  to  address  issues  of  interoperability  and  meagre defense budgets. It will accelerate our cooperation on cyber and space. If Europe is to be not just an economic but a geopolitical powerhouse, it is time for this debate to start in earnest. And those countries most eager to proceed can do so at a faster pace.           Our strategic interests in the Eastern Mediterranean, in the Middle East, in the Sahel force us to address this challenge with a sense of renewed urgency. Because there will be missions where NATO or the UN will not be present, but where the EU should be. Ladies and gentlemen, Let me conclude by saying this. Earlier  this  year  Greece  celebrated  the  200th  anniversary  from  the beginning of our war of independence. Our ancestors fought for freedom, dignity and respect for the rule of law. And they prevailed, against all odds, because they were doing the right thing for themselves and their children.  The challenges we are facing are no less formidable. Six thousand years of  civilization  and  the  futures  of  every  generation  to  come  rest  on  our shoulders.  Armed with the power of reason and science, and a determination to rise to  the  occasion,  I  am  convinced  we  will  also  do  the  right  thing.  For ourselves,  our  children  and  the  future  of  this  fragile  but  beautiful  blue planet humanity calls home.   Thank you for listening.            "
94,2021,VAT,Holy See,"President,  I am pleased to extend to you and all of the representatives of nations the warm greetings of Pope Francis.  In  his  Encyclical  Letter  Fratelli  Tutti  on  fraternity  and  social  friendship,  Pope  Francis surveyed  the  many  challenges  facing  the  international  community,  such  as  war  and conflict, mistreatment and violence, hunger and poverty, inequality and marginalization, individualism  and  mistrust,  extremism  and  polarization,  attacks  on  human  dignity,  the COVID-  pandemic  and  threats  to  the  environment,  among  other  “dark  clouds.”  To confront such difficulties effectively, we must approach them with “renewed hope” based on the “abundant seeds of goodness in our human family,” like those heroically sown in response to the medical, social, economic and spiritual dimensions of the pandemic. Such actions  reveal,  he  indicated,  that  the  medicine  the  world  needs  is  not  “isolation  and withdrawal into one’s own interests,” but rather fraternal closeness and hope grounded in the “reserves of goodness present in human hearts.”   Pope Francis, Encyclical Letter Fratelli Tutti, , , , 196.              The  theme  of  this  General  Debate,  “Building  Resilience  Through  Hope,”  focuses  our attention  on  the  crucial  importance  of  hope  in  human  affairs.  Hope  is  different  than optimism, which is an expectation that things will turn out well, or the idea that somehow history  will  inevitably  develop  on  an  upward  trajectory.  Instead,  we  know  that  our achievements are not unassailable: the maintenance of peace, the protection and promotion of human rights, the advance of integral human development, and the care for our common home, should  never  be  taken  for  granted,  but  must  be  sought  and  secured  by  every generation.  As new crises arise and others persist, we need hope to persevere in addressing them. Hope keeps  us  motivated  when  problems  and  disagreements  seem  unsolvable.  It  facilitates forgiveness. It keeps us conscious that through reconciliation there can be a better future. It fosters resilience and inspires us to put in hard work even when we may not be able to see results achieved in our lifetime.  For Christians, hope is the most divine gift that can exist in the heart of mankind. It sees and loves what will be, in time and in eternity. Hope “is expectation, fervent expectation, impassioned by the ultimate and definitive fulfilment of a mystery, the mystery of God’s love.”  [Recovering from COVID-]  Mr. President,  Pope  Francis  declared  last  year  in  his  address  to  the  General  Assembly  that  “we  never emerge from a crisis just as we were. We come out either better or worse.” To emerge better from the COVID- pandemic, we need to build on a renewed sense of fraternal solidarity. The pandemic has taught us how interconnected our world is, how every State has its own vulnerabilities and that no State is capable of resolving the crisis on its own.  Resilience  demands  that  the  international  community  put  into  action  the  commitments expressed  during  the  Special  Session  of  the  General  Assembly  on  COVID-  last December.  We  must  work  together  to  remedy  the  situation  of  those  who  are  on  the “pharmaceutical margins,” and to alleviate the needless suffering and death that they and  See Pope Francis, General Audience,  September 2017  Charles Peguy, The Portal of the Mystery of Hope  Pope Francis, General Audience,  October 2014.  Pope Francis, Address to the General Assembly of the United Nations,  September 2020.  Pope Francis, Address to the Members of the “Banco Farmaceutico” Foundation,  September 2020.          so many others have and continue to endure. This is particularly the case with regard to vaccines,  which  must  be  available  to  everyone,  especially  in  conflict  areas  and humanitarian settings.  Resilience requires a renewed examination of how health care systems have largely been overwhelmed by the pandemic and left so many without sufficient care or any care at all. Even today many have no access to testing, basic care, or vaccines or even to the energy infrastructure that would make such care possible. Resilience calls for an examination of the  fragility  and  shortfalls  of  our  economic systems,  which  have  left  many  behind  as  a result of the severe economic downturn and made the poor even more vulnerable.  Finally, resilience involves perseverance in the fight against corruption, since the harm of corruption has become particularly exposed among the political and distribution failures of the pandemic.   [Rebuilding sustainably]  Mr. President,  The pandemic has negatively impacted development programs and activities, as well the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Five years of progress on the  sustainable development goals was halted,  and in some cases reversed, by the virus and its consequences. Making sustainable development a reality by 2030, which two years ago appeared to be an uphill struggle with no certainty of success, has now become such a daunting challenge that tremendous efforts will be needed.  To  rebuild  sustainably,  we  must  rethink  the  relationship  between  individuals  and  the economy and ensure that both economic models and development programs remain at the service of men and women, particularly those on the margins of society, rather than exploit both people and natural resources. Sustainable development, if truly at the service of the human person, must also incorporate the poor, their gifts and creativity as agents of their own integral development. We must unleash the promise and hope they embody, for their good and the good of the entire human community.  [Responding to the Needs of the Planet]   Security Council Resolution 2565 (2021).  Pope Francis, Address to the Diplomatic Corps Accredited to the Holy See,  February 2021.   Pope Francis, Fratelli Tutti, 228.            Mr. President,  The  upcoming  COP  2610 in  Glasgow  is  an  important  opportunity  for  resilience,  as  the international community has the chance to commit anew to the protection of our common home. We are compelled to strengthen our ambition, since we are presently experiencing the  effects  of  decades  of  inaction  in  terms  of  the  extreme  flooding,  drought,  wildfires, melting  glaciers,  receding  shorelines,  malnutrition  and  respiratory  diseases  that  rising temperatures are precipitating. It is far past time to act.  The tragic natural disasters that have struck our brothers and sisters in Haiti, a people already suffering from political and humanitarian challenges, is a clear call to the international community to work together in solidarity for a durable and sustainable development of which the people of Haiti may be the principal protagonists. Recent  attention  toward  the  environment  has  spawned  great  advances  in  technology, allowing  us  to  provide  for  our  needs  sustainably.  Human  creativity  and  innovation  in improving efficiency and decreasing the costs of clean energy are making environmentally conscious choices by governments and individuals easier. Such innovations, while spurring similar entrepreneurial creativity, also inspire hope.  [Respecting the rights of people]  Mr. President,  Hope all too frequently is denied and remains elusive to so many women and men, boys and  girls  because  of  another  man-made  threat  to  our  common  existence,  namely  war, conflict and the possession and use of weapons of mass destruction. The scourge of war brings death and destruction, harms the environment, devastates communities and so often entraps  regions  and  countries  in  a  downward  spiral.  Sadly,  we  continue  to  witness  the terrible impact of crises and conflicts across the globe. The recent aggravated humanitarian situation in Afghanistan and the ongoing political tensions in Syria and Lebanon, as well as in other places, are a stark reminder of the impact that conflicts press upon peoples and nations. The Holy See calls upon States to heed the call of the Secretary-General and Pope Francis for a global ceasefire and a shared humanitarian responsibility.   26th Session of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).           The damage to our fellow human beings and our planet is a special cause of concern with regard  to  nuclear  arms  and  biological  and  chemical  weapons.  The  threat  of  nuclear weapons, possessed under the guise of nuclear deterrence, creates an ethos of fear based on mutual annihilation, and poisons relationships between peoples, obstructs dialogue, and undermines hope. Humanitarian and security issues require us to end the nuclear arms race and  to  undertake  effective measures  toward  nuclear  disarmament,  non-proliferation  and prohibition. The entry into force last January of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) is a major step forward. It is the firm hope of the Holy See that this will also spur progress in the implementation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), scheduled to hold its Review Conference next January.  Mr. President,  Pope Francis considers one of the most serious causes for concern in today’s world to be the “crisis of human relationships” flowing from a way of life  dominated by selfishness and by the culture of waste, where human values and the related transcendent dignity of the  person  are  often  trampled. This  “anthropological  crisis”  is  not  a  philosophical  or academic dispute, but a crisis with enormous practical consequences for human rights.  Our societies today are the theater of many injustices where human beings are maltreated, exploited,  ignored,  killed,  or  left to  languish  in  humanitarian  emergencies.  Women  and girls,  persons  from  different  indigenous,  racial,  ethnic,  and  linguistic  backgrounds experience violence and oppression or are reduced to second-class citizens. Far too often humanitarian law is taken as a recommendation rather than an obligation by both State and non-State actors alike. Refugees, migrants and internally displaced persons are increasingly left in limbo or even left to drown, unwelcome and unable to find a new home to raise their family in dignity, peace and security. Religious believers endure harassment, persecution, death and even genocide on account of their faith. The elderly and persons with disabilities are cast aside, especially when they are frail or considered burdensome. Innocent children are deemed problematic, discarded by society even before they are born or have the chance to bring their own, unique contribution into the world. The family, which the Universal Declaration  of  Human  Rights  recognizes  as  the  “natural  and fundamental  group  unit  of society,” is misrepresented. This is evident also in novel interpretations of existing human rights, separated from their underlying universal values. In many cases, “new rights”  not only contradict the values  Pope Francis, Address to the Diplomatic Corps Accredited to the Holy See,  February 2021.  Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article ..         they  are  supposed  to  support  but  are  imposed  despite  the  absence  of  any  objective foundation or international consensus. The Holy See believes that while depriving human rights of their original universal dimension, these new partial interpretations sadly become the ideological benchmark of spurious “progress” and another ground for polarization and division. Sadly, we are facing this in the constant pursuit of introducing controversial new agendas that drive UN processes contrary to the bodies’ given mandates. In an age in which many universal human rights continue to be violated with impunity, these attempts in fact confuse, divert from implementing the human rights conventions, and  impede  the  attention  and  energy  that  the  promotion  and  protection  of  fundamental human rights and dignity deserve. We need to build resilience through hope and consensus in  this  noble  institution,  while  defending  human  rights  and  fundamental  freedoms, including the right to life, to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, and to freedom of opinion and expression, and not to undermine them. [Revitalizing the United Nations] Mr. President,  To foster the resilience necessary to help the world emerge better from the various crises we face, the United Nations must constantly be  renewed through returning with greater fidelity  and  resolve  to  the  core  principles  and  purposes  enshrined  in  its  Charter.  True revitalization means not just making structures and mechanisms more efficient but ensuring that  this  institution  lives  up  to  its  true  and  commonly  agreed  upon  aims,  rather  than becoming a tool of the powerful. The structural deficiencies that exist cannot be remedied either by sluggish solutions or fast fixes but require a commitment to what Pope Francis terms a “healthy politics.” The need for a healthy politics, based on the pursuit of the common good and  universal truth,  is  particularly  important  at  the  Security  Council,  whose  members  are  called  to become  the  foremost  artisans  of  peace  throughout  the  world,  constantly  recommitting themselves to place international peace and rule of law above national interests or partisan ideologies. Far  too  often,  the  latter  inevitably  leads  to  gridlock,  while  the  poorest  and most vulnerable, who look to the Council for signs of hope, continue to suffer, pushed into  Archbishop Paul Richard Gallagher, Statement at the 46th Session of the Human Rights Council,  February 2021.  Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Articles ,  and .   Pope Francis, Fratelli Tutti, 177, 179.   Cf. Pope Francis, Address to the Diplomatic Community Accredited to the Holy See,  January 2019.          greater  despair.  Revitalizing  the  United  Nations  must  include  examining  whether  the structure conceived in 1945 remains adequate for 2021 and beyond, as well as recognizing that from those States to which more is given, more is to be expected, especially with regard to responsibility for the common good.  In  addition  to  the  structural  aspects  of  revitalization,  greater  attention  must  be  given  to promote and safeguard the mandates of UN entities and fora.  The Holy See views with concern the push of some to break down the helpful division of labor among Committees, commissions,  meetings  and  processes,  turning  all  into  bodies  that  focus  on  a  limited number of disputed issues. Furthermore, the principle of consensus must be safeguarded. One common step in the right direction is preferable to many steps in different directions. To help the world build resilience through hope, the United Nations must lead by example, and the States, entities, and personnel that comprise the Organization all have a key role to play in helping set that example. The Holy See is vigorously committed to playing its part.  [Conclusion]  In conclusion, Mr. President, to recover, rebuild, respond, respect and revitalize involves a rediscovery of resilience through firmly grounded hope.  Many are the signs of hope, even in our weary societies. To be builders of peace in our societies means to find these seeds and shoots of fraternity. “The God of the covenant asks us not to yield to separatism or partisan interests. He does not want us to ally ourselves with some at the expense of others. Rather, he wants individuals and communities to be bridges of fellowship with all.” Let us see in the eyes of migrants and refugees that they are full of suffering and hope. Let us work together to give them a future to blossom in peace. In March, while the effects of the pandemic were still being very much felt, Pope Francis went  to  Iraq  to  encourage  the  Iraqi  people  in  striving  to  give  the  world  an  example  of resilience through hope.  Visiting the birthplace of Abraham, to whom Jews, Christians and Muslims all look as their father  in  faith,  the  Pope  recalled  the  image  of  a  storm-tossed  sea  to  describe  what  is involved in building a culture of peace.   Pope Francis, Meeting with the Representatives of the Ecumenical Council of Churches and some Jewish communities in Hungary,  September 2021.           “It demands,” he said, “especially amid the tempest, that we row together,” and that no one “be concerned simply for his own affairs.” He continued, “There will be no peace as long as  we  see  others  as them and  not us.  There  will  be  no  peace  as  long  as  our  alliances are against others, for alliances of some against others only increase divisions. Peace does not  demand  winners  or  losers,  but  rather  brothers  and  sisters  who,  for  all  the misunderstandings and hurts of the past, are journeying from conflict to unity.” That is the way of hope, which all of us should walk in this Organization.  Thank you, Mr. President.    Pope Francis, Address at the Interreligious Meeting on the Plain of Ur,  March 2021.       "
95,2021,ITA,Italy,"President of the General Assembly, Mr. Secretary-General, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and gentlemen, In  recent  years  we  have  witnessed  a  progressive  weakening  of  multilateralism,  which  has guaranteed peace, security and prosperity since the post-war period. However, we are now facing problems that we cannot solve on our own. I am referring to the pandemic, and to the risk of new and dangerous variants of the virus. Climate change and the protection of biodiversity. The economic recovery and the fight against inequalities and food insecurity. Conflict resolution and the fight against terrorism. These issues are at the heart of today’s General Assembly and of our Government's agenda. They are also at the core of the Italian Presidency of the G20, whose motto is “People, Planet and Prosperity”. We need to relaunch multilateralism, and make it effective to meet the challenges of our times. More than a year and a half after the beginning of the global health crisis, we can finally look at the future with greater optimism. The vaccination campaign gives us confidence in our ability to return to a new normal. In Italy and in Europe we have reopened most economic activities. Students have returned to schools and universities. After months of loneliness, our social life has finally resumed.             However,  the  pandemic  is  not  over  and  even  when  it  will  be,  we  will  have  to  deal  with  its consequences for a long time.  Globally, we face dramatic differences in the distribution of vaccines. In high-income countries, more than % of the population has received at least one dose. In the poorest ones, only %.  These disparities are morally unacceptable: fewer vaccinations mean more deaths. And as long as the virus continues to circulate freely, it can mutate in dangerous ways and put even the most effective vaccination campaigns at risk. We need to increase the availability of vaccines for poor countries and overcome logistical hurdles to distribute them where they are most needed. Furthermore, we must preserve at the global level the free circulation of vaccines and of the raw materials needed to produce them. Italy gives its full political and financial support to the COVAX Facility. We intend to triple our donations from  to  million doses by the end of 2021. The huge differences in vaccination campaigns risk worsening inequalities between countries. The pandemic has had a negative social and economic effect on everyone, but the consequences for lower-income countries have been particularly severe. Even before the health crisis, these countries had significant economic vulnerabilities, starting with their debt levels. Many of their citizens lived below or just above the poverty line. Advanced economies have been able to use monetary and fiscal policies more robustly to contain the economic shock.  They spent % of their 2020 gross domestic product to stimulate growth – compared with just % and % in emerging and low-income economies. Economic divergence risks erasing years of progress in the fight against poverty, making it even more difficult to achieve sustainable development goals. Concerns about food systems have become even more urgent. Extreme weather conditions and  supply chain  disruptions have contributed to the  increase in food prices. In August the food price index rose by % compared to a year earlier. According to the FAO, last year more than , billion people did not have access to adequate food on a regular basis.        Under the Italian Presidency, the G20 has adopted a package of economic measures to help the world’s  most  fragile  countries  overcome  the  effects  of  the  pandemic  and  assist  them  in  their development. We supported the decision by the International Monetary Fund to issue new Special Drawing Rights for a total of $650 billion. Of these resources, $ billion are destined to African countries, and we are working to further increase this share. We  have  accelerated  the  refinancing  of  'IDA-',  the  World  Bank's  fund  for  the  poorest countries. The Italian Presidency intends to facilitate comprehensive and sustainable debt restructuring in countries with excessive debt levels. Italy has also taken specific action on food security.  Together with the FAO, we have created the “Food Coalition” to combat malnutrition caused by the Covid- pandemic and we have hosted in Rome the Pre-Summit on Food Systems. Nevertheless, we must  be ready for even more ambitious  action to support poorer countries, particularly in Africa. Italy intends to continue to ensure its support for the African continent, which is increasingly central for security and economic growth globally. We must increase investment, to enable Africa’s youth to participate fully in its social, economic and political development. The other emergency that we have placed at the core of our G20 Presidency agenda is climate change. The latest UN IPCC report shows that, without immediate, rapid and large-scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, we will fail to limit global warming to below , degrees above pre-industrial levels. The number of climate-related natural disasters has increased fivefold since the 1960s. Extreme weather events are expected to intensify over the next few decades. Estimates from the World Health Organization show that climate change already causes 150,000 deaths per year, which could become 250,000 between 2030 and 2050. We must act now to protect the planet, our economy and future generations. As Presidency of the G20 and COP26 co-chair together with the United Kingdom, Italy intends to reach ambitious goals on the three pillars of the Paris agreement: mitigation, adaptation and finance.  Over the next decade, we must reduce as much as possible CO2 emissions produced by fossil fuels and other greenhouse gases, including methane. And we must work to adapt our infrastructure to climate shocks, that have become increasingly frequent and violent.      Italy strongly supports the leading role of the European Union in the ecological transition, and in  particular  its  commitment  to  a  %  reduction  in  CO2  emissions  by  2030  and  to  net  zero emissions by 2050. However, the EU currently accounts for only % of global emissions, while G20 countries are responsible for %. The  fight  against  climate  change  requires  multilateral  engagement  and  pragmatic  cooperation among all major global players - both rich and emerging economies. We  must  act  in  an  effective,  coordinated  and  simultaneous  manner,  whilst  always  respecting national specificities. We  intend  to  reach  a  global  agreement  to  stop  the  use  of  coal  as  soon  as  possible,  and, consistently with this objective, block the financing of new projects of this kind. We want to eliminate subsidies for fossil fuels and promote the use of renewable sources. The environmental transition has significant costs and it is essential that governments stand ready to help citizens and businesses. But it can also be an engine of economic growth. According  to  a  recent  report  by  the  International  Renewable  Energy  Agency,  the  renewables sector could employ more than  million people by 2050. In  Italy  and  in  the  European  Union  at  large  we  have  embarked  on  a  path  of  reforms  and investment - “Next Generation EU” - to make the most of these opportunities. We  hope  that  the  “Roundtable  on  Climate”  promoted  last  Monday  by  Secretary-General Guterres and Prime Minister Johnson will give further impetus to the negotiations that will take us to the G20 Summit in Rome and to the COP26 in Glasgow. Next week, 400 young people from all over the world will meet in Milan to present their proposals for the fight against climate change. In recent years, young people have often been agents of change and have pushed us to do more. They will inherit the planet and it is our duty to listen to them.  In the past year, important issues affecting peace and security have resurfaced. The main one is Afghanistan, where we face the risk of a social and civil catastrophe. We must prevent the country from becoming once again a threat for international security. I refer in particular to the presence of groups affiliated with Al-Qaeda and Daesh on Afghan territory.  The international community must cooperate effectively, starting with sharing intelligence. Italy has long been involved at the international level in the fight against terrorism.  We  must  combine  our  security  objectives  with  prevention,  protection  of  human  rights  and respect for the rule of law. And we must tackle both the economic and the social causes that lead to radicalisation and violent extremism.      In Afghanistan, we are witnessing the dismantling of the progresses made over the last  years in the protection of fundamental freedoms, especially for women. All those who have signed the United Nations Charter and who adhere to the founding values of this Organization must commit to the resolution of this crisis. The international community must stand united in demanding that all Afghan citizens can live in dignity, peace and security;  that the protection of vulnerable groups is ensured; that women preserve their fundamental rights, first of all the right to education.  Italy  has  always  been  committed  to  promoting  the  respect  of  human  rights  in  the  world,  in particular in the last three years with an active presence in the Human Rights Council. The  composition  of  the  new  Afghan  government  does  not  meet  the  expectations  of  the international community for a government that is inclusive and representative of the country's diverse ethnic, social and religious components.  The new rulers must prove with their actions, and not only in words, that they are committed to respecting individual freedoms. We must also address the impact of the Afghan crisis on regional stability and security. To address such a complex matter, we need a strategy that is as widely shared as possible.   Italy has taken action immediately to encourage the strongest possible coordination among the main global and regional players.  As G20 Presidency, we have made available the G20 platform, which is broad and inclusive by nature.  We have promoted a meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs, in preparation for the extraordinary summit, which will focus on issues of humanitarian aid, security and human rights.  The humanitarian situation in Afghanistan is certainly the most pressing and shared concern, not least because of the approaching winter season. According to the World Food Programme, one in three people in the country is exposed to food insecurity. Italy  has  confidence  in  the  ability  of  the  United  Nations  to  coordinate  the  international humanitarian response, mobilise resources and ensure a rapid and coherent intervention. I would like to thank the Secretary-General for organising the “pledging conference” in Geneva on the  13th  September,  where  countries  pledged  some  $,  billion  in  humanitarian  aid  for Afghanistan. The extraordinary G20 Summit must give its utmost support to these objectives.  There has to be full, safe, unhindered and unconditional access for international organisations and humanitarian aid workers. Italy is at the forefront in the response to the humanitarian crisis, for the benefit of the most fragile groups in Afghanistan and of those Afghans who have left - or will leave - the country.  We are also ready to intervene in support of neighbouring countries affected by refugee outflows.      We have decided to use resources previously earmarked for training Afghan security and defence forces for humanitarian purposes.  The crisis in Afghanistan, and in particular its rapid deterioration following the withdrawal of “Resolute Support”, demands a reflection on the future of international missions. In particular, we must ask ourselves what are their objectives and what is the best way to pursue them. However, international interventions remain an essential tool in supporting peace and security. Italy reaffirms with conviction its commitment within the United Nations.  We are the largest contributor to the Blue Helmets among Western countries and the seventh largest contributor to the budget of UN peacekeeping operations.  Italian soldiers are deployed in five UN missions in Mali, Western Sahara, Cyprus, at the border between India and Pakistan, and above all in Lebanon, where we are in charge of the UNIFIL mission and deploy one of the largest contingents. We are convinced that the European Union needs to strengthen its role in this field, in line with the  ambitions  of  the  European  project  and  in  full  complementarity  with  the  Transatlantic Alliance. The  focus  on  Afghanistan  and  Central  Asia  should  not  distract  us  from  the  instability  that continues to affect the wider Mediterranean. In particular, we support, multilaterally, bilaterally and within the European Union, the transition process in Libya for a sustainable and inclusive solution to the crisis. Its aim is to renew the country’s national institutional framework in a unified manner, without external interference and under the aegis of the UN – as mapped out by the Libyans themselves. The international community must work together with  the Libyan institutions and the Libyan people to overcome the current stalemate. Despite this critical juncture, we must ensure that elections scheduled for the 24th of December can take place and the ceasefire is fully implemented. Another aspect of the Libyan crisis is migration. Its correct management requires a joint response from the international community.  We  must  fight  effectively  against  human trafficking,  ensure  regular  international  mobility  and protect people's lives. It is essential to have multilateral action, based on the principle of a fair sharing of duties and responsibilities. The European Union and its Member States must strengthen the dialogue on migration issues with the countries of origin and transit of migrants, in order to achieve joint responsibility in the management of flows. These principles inspire the cooperation between the European Union and its African partners, of which Italy has been an early promoter and that we intend to strengthen.       I would like to express the Italian Government's sincere appreciation for the  important work carried out by United Nations organisations in Libya and, more generally, in many areas of crisis. In  particular,  I  am  referring  to  the  International  Organization  for  Migration  and  the  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Italy  is  committed  to  continuing  to  work  to  promote  the  universal  values  of  peace  and development, and the protection and promotion of human rights. These  are  not  only  at  the  core  of  the  UN's  action,  but  they  are  also  the  basis  of  the  Italian Constitution, the European Union and the transatlantic bond. The  principles  that  inspired  the  United  Nations  Charter,  and  that  we  recalled  in  our  Solemn Political Declaration, adopted on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Organisation, are still a point of reference today.  Within the UN, the Security Council must be able to continue to fulfil its role in safeguarding international peace and security.  We  support  the need for a  consensual  reform  of  the Security  Council,  to  strengthen regional representation and ensure a fairer geographical distribution of seats through an increase in the number of elected members. Our  goal  is  to  make  the  Council  more  representative,  democratic,  efficient,  transparent  and accountable. The answer to the challenges we face - the pandemic, climate change and international crises - lies in effective multilateralism, based on inclusive and open dialogue. Italy  wants  to  continue  to  contribute  with  ideas  and  resources,  for  the  benefit  of  the  entire international community.      "
96,2021,MLT,Malta,"President Mr Secretary General Distinguished Delegates, Before  COVID-  nearly  two  years  ago,  we  were  planning  to  celebrate  the  75th anniversary  of  the  United  Nations  by  reinvigorating  multilateralism.  As  the pandemic struck and disrupted all States, large and small, it showed us that only when working together can we tackle common challenges. If anything, COVID only reaffirmed  the  priority  of  multilateralism,  and  that  it  is  the  key  to  a  strong  and sustainable future.  As the international community present here today, we would all agree that this pandemic was not just a health crisis: but a multi- faceted one, due to its domino effect upon our humanitarian, security, human rights and socio-economic stability. We  mourn  the  tragic  loss  of  life  it  has  caused,  despite  all  our  efforts.  These  are immensely  challenging  times,  and  as  country  leaders  we  have  to  also  deal  with increasing  isolation  and  the  fear  that  COVID    caused  among  our  citizens.  The height of the pandemic necessitated unprecedented sacrifice and restrictions that affected our freedom of movement, severely disrupted the education of children and young people, left millions jobless, and isolated the most vulnerable around the world. Yet this experience also taught us that we could defeat hopelessness by supporting each other, by pooling our knowledge base, our scientific research and by offering humanitarian support. It is this spirit of multilateralism that supported our determination to tackle the pandemic, and it is this same spirit that will enable us to build a strong and sustainable future together.     As we slowly emerge from the pandemic, we must come together to forge ahead with  plans  that  demonstrate  our  determination  and  commitment  to  a  strong recovery that leads to a more equal, inclusive, resilient and sustainable world.  Here, I want to take a moment to acknowledge and refer to the fact that for the first  time  in    years,  the  World  Bank  announced  a  significant  rise  in  poverty numbers,  with  the  2021  figures  showing  an  estimated  increase  in  COVID--induced poor of between 143 and 163 million. This means that the goal of bringing the  global  absolute  poverty  rate  to  less  than    percent  by  2030,  is  now  beyond reach unless we embark on swift, significant, and targeted policy actions.  We  cannot  afford  to  respond  to  the  devastating  effects  of  COVID-  merely  by limiting  ourselves  to  rhetoric.  The  principles  of  “leaving  no  one  behind”  and “building back better,” must be implemented by providing and mobilising sufficient aid  and  resources;  ensuring  that,  for  example,  vaccines  are  fairly  distributed  to those  who  urgently  require  them  and  ensuring  a  level  playing  field  by  assisting regions of the world that continue to have difficulties in importing vaccines.  This is why Malta is a proud co-sponsor of UN Security Council Resolution that seeks to ensure equitable and affordable access to COVID- vaccines in armed conflict and post-conflict situations, and during complex humanitarian emergencies. And as a nation we welcome the work being undertaken to address vaccine inequality. Whilst I am proud to say that as of today, Malta has vaccinated around  % of its population, we stand fully committed to vaccine sharing with countries in need. It is in this spirit that this summer, Malta donated ,000 vaccine doses to Libya and we will donate even further with the aim of helping our neighbouring country get a million doses by the end of this year.     Despite all the ongoing efforts, however, the crisis is far from over.  Echoing the words of the United Nations Secretary-General, a significant push at the highest political level is needed to reverse some of the effects of the pandemic, avoid  a  global  recession,  and  get  back  on  track  to  fulfil  the  2030  Agenda  for Sustainable Development within this Decade of Action and Delivery.  Malta has formulated a post COVID- strategy that places the community at the centre stage. The strategy was formulated using a bottom-up approach that looks at our strengths, vulnerabilities and potential in a bid to make Malta a smarter and more resilient economy.  Mr. President The  pandemic  has  significantly  slowed  global  economic  activity  and  the  effects represent  one  of  the  largest  international  economic  shocks  the  world  has experienced in recent decades.  As  the  global  trade  environment  continues  to  be  in  a  state  of  flux,  ensuring  an economic,  environmental  and  social  recovery  that  is  fair  and  inclusive  is  of  the utmost  importance.  Debt  guarantees,  financial  aid,  and  loans  from  international financial  institutions  are  required  in  order  to  provide  the  impetus  for  economic recovery  and  revitalisation.  The  EU  Digital  Covid  Certificate,  for  example,  was  a successful step forward to recovery via tourism.         I  also  believe  that  upon  assessing  the  aftermath  of  the  COVID-  pandemic,  we need to re-think our basic economic model and adapt it to similar events which are likely to take place in the future.  With  this  in  mind,  I  firmly  support  the  idea  of  an  inclusive  and  resilient  post-pandemic  recovery  that  is  based  on  an  open  and  rules-based  approach  to international  trade  and  foreign  direct  investment.  Action  should  be  focused  on ensuring  the  proper  implementation  of  existing  rules,  as  well  as  the  negotiation and implementation of new rules on issues that have emerged over the years. Fair competition should be at the heart of any approach for a post-pandemic economic recovery.  While we refocus our efforts on recovering together, we have to work and collaborate with the UN and other organisations to usher in a more networked and inclusive multilateral approach, to echo what the Secretary General stressed in his International Day of Diplomacy Message earlier this year. It is also the best form of preparedness against the global challenges that are impacting us all, particularly Climate Change.  Only through collective efforts that transform our present economic model into one that truly fosters social and environmental cohesion, can we truly and effectively respond to the needs of our planet responsibly, by building networks at all levels to foster a change in mind set across all strata of society. As political leaders the major responsibility falls upon us but we must engage with the private sector, academia, and entities from all walks of life to stop human induced climate change and seek solutions to adapt to its negative repercussions after we have done all we can to mitigate it.    In  this  regard,  a  successful  COP-  is  critical  to  meet  our  long-term  climate neutrality objective. I am proud to state that achieving carbon neutrality is one of the five major pillars of my country’s economic vision for 2030. My government has adopted  a  Low  Carbon  Development  Strategy  that  integrates  mitigation  with adaptation,  which  includes  significant  investments  in  the  sectors  of  waste management,  road  transport,  renewable  energy  and  the  energy  efficiency  of buildings.  Despite  the  severe  economic  impact  COVID-  has  had  upon  national finances,  our  programme  for  an  ambitious  decarbonisation  programme  has  not waivered.  As one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change within the EU, Malta is a keen advocate in favour of a focus on adaptation.  Small Island States are amongst the  lowest  emitters  but  the  most  vulnerable  to  climate  change.  We  also  have limited  options  to  reduce  emissions,  leading  us  to  incur  higher  marginal  and disproportionate abatement costs. As leaders, we have a significant role to play and the  responsibility  to  act  without  delay.  In  this  regard,  I  welcome  the  adoption, earlier this year, of an EU strategy on adaptation and the renewed focus on this topic by the UN. Climate Change by itself, and as a threat multiplier, poses significant challenges that may  exacerbate  long-existing  vulnerabilities  and  emerging  conflicts  as  well  as threaten  the  very  existence  of  some  countries  and  regions.  In  view  of  this,  the relationship between climate and security will be high on Malta’s agenda if elected to the UN Security Council for the term 2023-2024. As part of this agenda, we will place particular emphasis on bridging the gap between science and global security concerns, especially the ocean, as the single largest habitat on our planet.     Malta is committed to ensuring that the voices of those States mostly affected by the  impacts  of  Climate  Change  are  heard.  As  we  are  continuously  witnessing, climate change is triggering severe and frequent weather phenomena that bring entire regions and States to their knees. We need to act before it is too late. To this effect, as a country we have been actively and continuously working within the relevant UN Structures and with other Member States to raise awareness on the needs and capabilities of such countries. Our belief is that genuine and durable partnerships can assist in the fulfilment of the Sustainable Development Goals, the fight against climate change and the opportunities for decarbonisation, as well as in addressing the threats to our ocean and the potential we share to develop the Blue Economy. As a founding member of the Alliance of Small Island Developing States, Malta’s goal is to become a leader in Small Island State Governance, standing ready to share our  plans  on  decarbonisation  and  also  digitalisation.  Small  Island  States  face challenges  regarding  their  critical infrastructure,  but in  parallel,  can  also demonstrate how effective the community-based approach is. As our society will go through a digital transition in parallel with the climate one, as a  country  we  also  advocate  the  need  to  close  the  digital  gap  across  nations  to ensure  a  level  playing  field.  Although  Malta  enjoys  a  positive  and  professional relationship as a ‘Digital Island’, we aim to further enhance our potential in the field and fast track our digital transformation. Our aim is to implement modernised and secure digital services that are accessible to all.  These efforts will circumvent any of the disruptions caused by COVID- notably in the economy, education, health and public administration. Digitalisation will benefit and empower humanity if it is accessible to all our peoples, even those in the most remote parts of the world.     Mr President, Another common goal and shared priority is that of ensuring human rights remain at the core of what we do. The full realisation of all human rights and fundamental freedoms is a priority for Malta, and we are especially concerned with reports of increased  violence  against  women  around  the  world.  Our  systems  must  be strengthened  to  prevent  the  proliferation  of  this  scourge.  We  must  ensure  that perpetrators  are  brought  to  justice,  victims  are  supported,  and  an  enabling environment  is  created  for  women  to  be  able  to  fully,  equally,  and  effectively participate in public life.   Malta on the Security Council will continue to stress the need to include women and youths in peacekeeping and peacebuilding efforts. Their voices must be heard if we are to build fair and inclusive societies. Just as peace agreements have been seen to last longer when women and youths are present at the peace table, so can women  and  youth  contribute  to  various  spheres  of  society,  and  ensure  that  all voices  are  heard  and the  needs  of the  most  vulnerable  are  met.  It  is  our  responsibility  to  ensure  that  women  are  given  the  space  to  become enablers for change. It is similarly our responsibility to provide a safe and secure environment where our society can flourish, a commitment that cannot easily be achieved when peace and security continues to be threatened across the continents. As prospective elected members  of  the  Security  Council,  Malta  believes  that  refocusing  and  revitalising our efforts at addressing and mitigating tensions is paramount. More must be done to assist the main actors on the ground and to address the root causes of conflict.      Such goals can be achieved by providing basic needs, which instability and conflict has taken away, whether it is basic education, literacy or food security.  On this occasion I have to say a few words on Libya. The  future  of  Libya  must  remain  at  the  forefront  of  our  common  agenda  for international  peace  and  stability.  The  international  community  needs  to  provide support  to  the  Libyan  authorities,  under  the  auspices  of  the  United  Nations,  to make sure that the political transition is a successful one – for the Libyan people, the region, the African Continent and the world.   The will of the Libyan people must be respected, and the October 2020 ceasefire agreement  fully  implemented,  while  the  work  of  the  Independent  Fact-Finding Mission on Libya set up last year should continue to be supported and reinforced. Mercenaries, foreign fighters and forces must withdraw from Libya, and the arms embargo must be respected.  In the run-up to Libya’s upcoming national elections, this process should continue to be strengthened with the adoption of the necessary social and economic reforms combined  with  an  underlying  national  reconciliation  process.  All  of  this  should translate to, amongst others, the unification of state institutions, the commencing of  security  sector  reform,  as  well  as  disarmament,  demobilisation,  and reintegration.  We  hope  that  the  strengthening  of  these  elements  would  bring Libyans together as they determine their collective effort towards a common future and a peaceful, prosperous Libya. Malta is actively supporting Libya in its economic development and just days ago, we marked our first commercial flight between our two countries. This is an important step forward for Libyan stability and prosperity.      At  the  same  time,  however,  we  cannot  ignore  the  impact  that  political developments in the  wider region  have  on the  situation in  Libya.  The situation in the Sahel remains tenuous, necessitating an integrated approach driven  by  a  strong  political  commitment.  This  instability  in  the  region  will  have implications and spill-over effects in other areas, including migration and terrorism.  More specifically on the latter, terrorism is a trans-regional phenomenon, which knows no border, and continues to pose a major threat to peace and security in various regions across Africa, particularly in Western and Central Africa, as well as the  Sahel.  It  remains  imperative  for  the  international  community  to  continue  to work together and address the root causes of violent extremism and radicalisation, with the aim of countering terrorism, as well as its financing. Terrorists are adept at exploiting countries with weak counter-terrorism capabilities, hence, the need to address such challenges is even more important.  Action against terrorism must be firm and decisive at all times and the UN is central to the fight. Literacy has, in my view, a critical role to play in empowering individuals to counter radicalisation  efforts.  This  also  links  with  the  importance  of  strengthening  the capacities  of  national  criminal  justice  systems  to  administer  fair  and  effective justice for perpetrators of terrorist crimes, while undertaking effective preventive measures in accordance with rule of law.  From a local perspective, the International Institute on Justice and the Rule of Law in Malta founded in June 2014, has been very active in convening practitioners from across  the  world,  to  provide  rule  of  law-based  training  to  lawmakers,  police,      prosecutors, judges, corrections officials and other justice sector stakeholders on how to address terrorism and related transnational criminal activities within a rule of law framework.  Furthermore, in the past  months, Malta implemented further reforms to bolster the anti-money laundering and counter terrorism financing framework. We have enacted  wide  ranging  legislation,  including  constitutional  changes,  substantially increased  capacity  and  resources in  several  key institutions,  and  further implementation is already underway.    Mr President, I also want to touch upon the situation in the Middle East, Afghanistan and Syria. Malta  reaffirms  its  commitment  to  a  just  and  comprehensive  resolution  of  the Israeli-Palestinian conflict centred on a two-state solution based on United Nations Security  Council  Resolutions  and  the  international  parameters  with  Jerusalem serving as the future capital of both States. Malta welcomes the normalisation of diplomatic  relations  between  the  State  of  Israel  and  Morocco,  United  Arab Emirates, Sudan and Bahrain. Actions that promote peace and stability in the region should  continue  to  be  supported,  including  preparations  to  hold  elections  in Palestine.  The conclusion of a ceasefire earlier this year was a step in the right direction. We urge  both  sides  to  take  concrete  steps  to  consolidate  the  fragile  peace,  and  to refrain from taking any action which may jeopardise any positive trends. As regards Afghanistan, the unfolding developments there have shocked us all and I want to join others in urging all parties to exercise utmost restraint. The situation on the ground remains highly volatile and bleak.  I also want to echo calls for all     involved  to  put  an  end  to  the  violence,  to  respect  international  law  and  uphold human  rights,  especially  the  rights  of  women  and  girls  whilst  ensuring  safe  and orderly departure of foreign nationals and Afghans who wish to leave the country. In this regard, roads, airports and border crossings must remain open, and calm maintained.  Afghan nationals must not be abandoned to their fate.  Humanitarian access  is  crucial,  and  all  humanitarian  actors  must  have  unimpeded  access  to deliver timely and life-saving services and assistance.   Similarly, I want to show my support for the words of the UN Secretary-General, that the international community must unite and ensure that Afghanistan is never again used as a platform or haven for terrorist organisations. Regarding Syria, the situation on the ground remains unstable. Not only have ten years passed since the conflict began, but the struggles that families and children are  facing  have  become  even  more  precarious.  The  persisting  violence  in  Syria, particularly in view of ongoing reports of sexual and gender-based violence, attacks on  children,  hospitals,  schools,  and  other  vital  civilian  infrastructure  including potable water production plants is of grave concern. We welcome the unanimous adoption of UNSCR 2585 extending the use of the humanitarian aid corridor at Bab al-Hawa. We urge all parties to refrain from further violence and take any and all appropriate actions leading to a resolution of this humanitarian and political crisis. The International Community must redouble its efforts to bring peace to Syria. We cannot remain idle.  Peace  and  security  are  fundamental  if  we  have  any  ambition  to  protect international  humanitarian  principles  and  minimise  the  impact  of  conflict  on innocent civilians, including those who are the most vulnerable. Too many people live in countries where their access to water, food, education, and other essential    needs is not met or is denied. As potential members of the Security Council, we will commit to addressing the root causes of conflict and to promote recognition of the crucial role of humanitarian space. Conflicts  affect  the  lives  of  many  people,  and  on  a  yearly  basis  we  fail  tens  of thousands of children. We fail to protect them from violence, from cruelty, from harm, and from realising their full potential. We fail to protect their right of being children. Every year, children are forced into armed movements, abducted, abused, and forced to take part into conflicts that they have not created. The new worrying trends  together  with  the  multifaceted  impacts  on  children  exacerbated  by  the pandemic, are calling us to redouble our efforts to tackle this “plague” together. The  protection  of  children  must  be  central  in  our  policy  and  decision-making processes. This goal is attainable, but we must act with urgency. UN peacekeeping operations have a key role to play in protecting children in armed conflict, as well as others within the UN system, including UNICEF.  We  strongly  encourage  the  Council  and  Member  States  to  support  the  full implementation of strong child protection mandates, including through the speedy deployment of senior child protection advisors and teams, and by prioritising the protection of children in peacekeeping transitions. Should Malta be entrusted to serve on the Security Council in 2023-2024, Children and Armed Conflict will be a priority during our tenure. We firmly believe that this issue, which greatly impacts our societies, should be mainstreamed across the work of the Security Council.        Mr President, We live in an interconnected world in which actions and policies taken by any State can leave a severe impact on third countries.   Consequently, I firmly believe that a response which is multilateral in its approach, for a strong multilateral framework with a revitalised United Nations at its core, is the  need  of  the  hour.  We  need  to  strengthen  our  work  on  the  affirmation  of universal rules and principles, and we need to join forces and make rapid progress on the common goal of rehabilitating multilateralism. Only by working together and in solidarity can we end the pandemic and effectively tackle its consequences. Only together  can  we  build  resilience  against  future  pandemics  and  other  global challenges. Multilateralism is not an option but a necessity as we build back better for a world which is more equal, resilient, and sustainable. Only through collective action can we truly recover together.  Without an adequate global response, the cumulative effects of the pandemic and its economic fallout, armed conflict, and climate change will exact high human and economic costs well into the future. This is a risk that we cannot take especially in these  unprecedented  times  where  cooperation  and  solidarity  among  states  is needed more than ever before. Malta is ready to support the global effort and be an effective international change agent by assisting the alignment of economic strategies, promoting a collaborative international  conversation,  and  drive  technological  innovation  whilst  remaining sensitive to societal and cultural implications.      If elected to the UN Security Council for the term 2023-2024, Malta will commit to support the UN as a neutral member state actively pursuing peace, security and social progress among all nations across the world. Malta  stands  united  with  the  international  community  to  build  a  better  world, where understanding and cooperation are at the heart of our policies and the work we  do  on  the  ground.    Where  we  work  together  in  a  unified  and  multilateral manner. Our citizens, and our children who will inherit the world after us, truly deserve it. Thank You.         "
97,2021,MNE,Montenegro,"President of Montenegro Milo Đukanović (Intervention in the General Debate of the 76th Session of the UN General Assembly New York,  September 2021) Dear Mr President, Dear Secretary General, Your Excellences, Ladies and Gentlemen, It  is  a  great  honour  for  me  to  address  you  on  behalf  of  Montenegro  and  to reconfirm our determined commitment to the principles and tenets of UN Charter and to the mission and goals of the World Organization.  It is also a great pleasure to be here again, in this great hall and with all of you, despite the risks and fears caused by the pandemic. Being here we show strong determination to confirm that multilateralism continues living.  I would like to thank the UN Secretariat and services of the host country for the enormous efforts they have invested to make it possible for the  General Debate not only to be a demonstration of hope and belief that the world will deal with the pandemic, but also a secure and safe event for all participants.  Activities of the United Nations in providing the desperately needed medical and humanitarian aid, as well as significant support in treating the serious economic consequences of the pandemic, undoubtedly confirm their important role in the modern world. Today, more than ever, it is clear that we can successfully respond to  global  challenges  only  if  we  act  on  a  global  level  –  by  a  concerted  and coordinated action of all of us. And it is the United Nations that have to stand at the core of that action. Your Excellences,  Enormous  problems  and  crises  that  are  unfortunately  increasingly  numerous, require  strong  leadership.  Without  leadership  the  world  will  not  be  able  to provide what our citizens expect and are entitled to. To our common misfortune, the world has lately been faced with a leadership crisis. The consequences of that crisis  can  be  seen  in  almost  all  spheres  of  global  relations.  Fragmentation  and international national  approaches  still  prevail stakeholders. Instead of joint tangible actions, we more often share only our joint concerns. in  the  behaviour  of  key Clear vision and commitment, quality and continuity, efficiency and effectiveness, cooperation and solidarity, determination and responsibility – make the only path for dealing with the growing global problems  – starting with the pandemic and climate change, through famine and migrations, to violation of human rights and humanitarian crises. In that, you will always have an open and reliable partner in Montenegro.          Mr President The  topic  of  this  year’s  debate  refers  to  the  generally  accepted  opinion  that understanding and adequate treatment of multidimensional consequences of the pandemic,  aimed  at  building  sustainable  future,  will  largely  mark  the  future actions  and  behaviours  of  states  and  other  international  factors.  It  is  clear  that reinvigorated  multilateralism  and  revitalization  of  the  United  Nations  are desperately needed. One step towards that goal is the initiative of the Secretary General  to  respond  to  emergencies  in  health,  and  to  social  and  economic aftermaths of the pandemic by establishing the Covid  Response and Recovery Fund  and  UN  Global  Humanitarian  Response  Plan.  We  warmly  welcome  the initiative. Our response must be solidary and equally accessible.  Covid  pandemic is the most serious crisis since the establishment of the World Organization. However, by mature and more responsible approach, we can learn lessons from every crisis – this time the lesson is a loud warning of how important it is to stand together and to ensure international solidarity in seeking for global solutions. It seems that the world is at a crossroad: We can either choose further isolationism  and  erosion  of  trust,  tolerating  the  increase  of  xenophobia, nationalism and right-wing ideas, ignoring the alarming warnings about the state of the environment, and silently accepting increase of inequality in all fields; or we can make a breakthrough to have a more secure and better future for all and take the path of the “common agenda” – “for people, for the planet, for prosperity and for peace” as the Secretary General Guterres said. It would mean opting for the future  that  will  be  based  on  the  highest  values  of  equality  and  justice, responsibility and solidarity, and not on the retrograde ideologies, selfishness and cheep populism.  I am sure that we mustn’t have any dilemma in the process of choosing between these options. We – the leaders and our citizens – have a unique opportunity to use  the  current  crisis  as  a  momentum  to  build  a  greener,  more  just  and  more sustainable world.  That  mission  will  require  efficient  and  strengthened  multilateralism,  with  the rhetoric  that  withdraws,  giving  room  to  deeds.  To  overcome  the  existing geostrategic  divisions  and  dysfunctional  international  relations  we  will  need  a new worldview within our states and a renewed global agreement between the states. Post pandemic recovery and revitalized multilateralism must be based on fair  globalization,  respect  for  human  rights  and  dignity  of  all,  environment protection and responsible attitude to nature, and results that will be measured by humane parameters, and not only by economic ones. We should not strive for peace which would be nothing else, but a mere absence of war and we should not strive for development only for the sake of profits. We should strive for peace and progress  that  will  be  built  on  achieving  the  highest  democratic  standards  and quality of life for all – equally for current and future generations.  The  process  of  strengthening  multilateral  approach  should  come  together  with our work on the strengthening of cooperation in the digital sphere, particularly       now  when  we  are  witnessing  the  influence  of  technology  on  the  post-crisis recovery and implementation of the sustainable development goals.  Montenegro will continue supporting the efforts invested in the implementation of the reform agenda within the developmental and managerial structures, as well as structures for preserving peace and stability and implementation of the 2030 Agenda. We are convinced that functioning of the World Organization can be made more efficient and more flexible only through necessary reorganization.  Mr President,  Supporting  the  initiative  of  the  Secretary  General  Guterres  “Action  for Peacekeeping”,  Montenegro  again  demonstrated  political  commitment  to  the mandates of peace operations and their efficient activities, particularly in the field of  protection  of  civilians.  We  remain  determined  to  contribute,  within  our capacities, to preservation and enhancement of international peace and security and to extend our participation in UN humanitarian and peacekeeping missions. Due to the obvious deterioration of the overall international security atmosphere, modernization of armed systems, as well as due to the collapse of some of the most important  strategic  instruments  in  this  field,  international  architecture  for disarmament,  non-proliferation  and  control  of  arms  are  under  a  significant pressure.  That  is  something  that  Montenegro,  as  a  responsible  UN  and  NATO member,  wants  to  draw  your  attention  to.  Support  to  implementation  and strengthening and to further development of multilateral agreements in the field of disarmament, non-proliferation and control of arms must be imperatives for all of us.  Montenegro will also continue working on integration of human rights and gender perspective  in  all  aspects  of  UN  work,  defending  universality  of  international human rights law and independence of the human rights system. As a candidate with realistic chances to become a member of the Human Rights Council, we will advocate approximation of the agendas and better synergy between Geneva and New  York.  Only  in  that  way  we  will  have  an  opportunity  to  react  timely  and prevent mass violations that keep occurring and shocking the world’s public on rather  frequent  occasions.  Until  we  do  that,  we  will  keep  reacting  post  festum, almost  as  a  rule,  and  spending  our  resources  dominantly  on  de-escalation  and dealing with humanitarian crises instead on managing and preventing them. It  is  in  such  a  light  that  we  should  also  observe  the  obvious  deterioration  of security and humanitarian situation, while we are preparing for potentially new and  stronger  wave  of  migrants  that  will  undoubtedly  have  regional  and  global repercussions. We appeal for a global response to the refugee and migrant crisis. We  have  to  share  responsibility,  as  we  envisaged  in  the  global  agreements  for refugees  and  migrants.  We  must  cooperate  in  seeking  the  solutions  and  help equally to countries of reception and countries of origin. Montenegro is the only of the republics of former Yugoslavia that did not have war in its territory during the  conflicts  in  1990s.  At  that  time  Montenegro  accepted  more  than  100  000 refugees  and  displaced  persons,  which  was  more  than  %  of  our  entire       population. As a UN member, Montenegro finds it very difficult to understand and accept any other approach but solidarity and support for the most vulnerable.  Your Excellences,  We  are  witnessing  the  growing  climate  and  environmental  crisis.  Recently  in Geneva,  the  High  Commissioner  for  Human  Rights  presented  very  concerning findings about global human rights situation in the context of the environment. Climate change, pollution and loss of biodiversity will constitute by far the most serious challenge for human rights in our era, said the High  Commissionaire. In that, she clearly recognized human activity as one of the factors and the lack of proper activities as another.  Full implementation of 2030 Agenda and Paris Climate Agreement are crucial for better  recovery  from  the  pandemic  and  preparation  of  the  world  for  future systemic shocks. That is why it is particularly important that in preparations for the  Summit  and  Conference  in  Glasgow  in  November  this  year,  all  countries mobilise an additional level of ambition for achieving long-term goals for reducing global warming. Although its share in the global emissions is tiny, in December 2020 Montenegro additionally increased its climate ambition, confirming thus the strong and persistent commitment to adequate treatment of climate challenges. We expect that further activities on the national level will open the space for new and more ambitious breakthroughs. That is why it is exceptionally important to integrate the components of action that will be based on human rights, both when new climate ambitions are set, and when  new global  biodiversity framework is defined.  Ladies and gentlemen,  This year Montenegro celebrated  years since restoration of its independence and  the  time  when  Montenegrin  flag  was  hoisted  for  the  first  time  on  the  East River. Montenegro covered a demanding path from its admission to the UN family, which  was  the  broadest  recognition  of  its  restored  independence,  through  its positioning on the main course of UN and our key foreign-policy partners, to the visibility, recognition, and affirmation that we have today and that by far exceed the size of our country.  The path that we have covered was never easy. Particularly not in the Balkans that is burdened by its past and that keeps being the place where conflicting influences clash, and geostrategic interests compete. It keeps being an object of concern of various international actors, but not always an object of the needed attention.  Your Excellences,  Challenges  and  threats  to  multi-ethic  democracy  in  the  Balkans  have  not dwindled.  Western  Balkans  is  yet  again  a  battlefield  for  conflicting  geopolitical interest,  the  consequence  of  which  is  slowing  down  of  integration  of  Western Balkan societies into their natural European setting, which undermines trust and adoption  of  European  values.  This  confusion  does  not  only  lead  to  a  halt  and         further lagging behind in the development of this European region, but also opens the space for restoration of destructive theories that claim that, due to the fact that it is lagging behind, this region cannot live as a multi-ethnic and multi-confessional community  and  that  its  states  cannot  be  functional.  They  want  to  impute  this constructed  thesis  to  Bosnia  and  Herzegovina  in  particular,  but  also  to  smaller countries  in  the  region,  to  make  an  alibi  for  restoration  of  greater-state nationalistic  projects  that  in  the  1990s  led  to  the  war  in  Western  Balkans  with almost 150000 deaths.  Our determination to fight these retrograde and dangerous ideas has not wavered and  therefore  today,  from  this  place,  Montenegro  is  warning  of  the  renewed danger that Western Balkans will be destabilized, and the horizons of its European prospects reduced.  Montenegro  has  persisted  on  building  a  better  future  for  its  citizens  on  the foundations of equality and without discrimination. It has been building relations of trust and cooperation with all its neighbours. It was, as the highest officials of our hosts used to say, an oasis of peace in the Balkans in the war years of 1990s. As a contributor to regional security, Montenegro became a member of NATO and it  is  a  leader  in  the  process  of  European  integration.  In  spite  of  numerous challenges,  Montenegro  remains  determined  to  defend  civic,  inclusive,  multi-ethnic and European democracy and to be a proof that multi-ethnic democracy is possible in the Balkans and that it is the only guarantee of prosperity.  Montenegro will remain loyal to such an orientation and strongly committed to the values of multilateralism, friendly and open cooperation, further democratic consolidation and strengthening of the rule of law. Among other things, this will lead to the strengthening of our partnership with the World Organization.  Thank you for your attention!     "
98,2021,MKD,North Macedonia,"President Pendarovski at the General Debate of the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly Distinguished President of the United Nations General Assembly, Distinguished Secretary-General of the United Nations, Esteemed Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, I am especially honored and privileged to address this eminent gathering for the first time on behalf of the Republic of North Macedonia. The very fact that most of the leaders are here today, instead of addressing this Assembly via video messages, speaks that the beginning of the end of the pandemic is in sight. For the past almost two years, there has been almost no country that has not been  severely  affected  by  COVID-.  Faced  with  an  unprecedented  plight, humanity came together and mobilized all its capacity in order to mitigate the consequences of the pandemic and to prepare for the post-COVID era.  Despite the disparities between the most developed countries and all the rest that came to the surface again, we witnessed a series of great exemplary cases of solidarity and humanness all around the world. Although there is still a long way  to  go,  we  can  finally  see  a  light  at  the  end  of  the  tunnel  and  re-focus towards the future. Hence, we need to support new ideas and initiatives, such as the G7 initiative Build Back Better World, an infrastructure partnership aimed at assisting the developing world, strongly affected by COVID-.    The pandemic, like any other huge scourge in human history is a lesson that must be learned. Not only COVID-, but most of the challenges humanity is facing  do  not  stop  at  our  national  borders  or  differentiate  among  nations, religions  or  ideologies.  We  can  deal  with  all  global  challenges  –  be  them security, pandemics or climate change – only with more empathy, cooperation and solidarity.  Ladies and Gentlemen, The  reality  today  is  that  our  world  is  far  from  being  a  safe  place  to  live  in. Conflicts around the world, fresh or frozen, terrorism, hybrid threats continue to intimidate our peace and way of life. They continue to threaten human rights and freedoms, provoking humanitarian catastrophes and waves of refugees. We  are  particularly  worried  with  the  latest  development  in  Afghanistan.  We share  the  concern  of  many  leaders,  including  UN  Secretary  General,  who      warned that the world is facing yet another humanitarian plight and called for helping hands, united efforts and solidarity.  Guided by the sense of moral obligation, as well as solidarity, my country, North Macedonia,  immediately  announced  its  readiness  to  host  a  considerable number of Afghan refugees, particularly the most vulnerable categories and the people who have worked for United Nations agencies in that country for many years.  For  hundreds  of  them  safe  haven  has  already  been  provided  and conditions for a dignified life. A baby was born in the local hospital immediately after  the  first  plane  with  Afghan  refugees  landed  at  the  Skopje  airport,  a symbolic sparkle of hope and a proof that life, indeed, prevails! We stand ready to contribute to the efforts of the international community in order to ensure a better life for these people, affected by the military chaos and destruction.  The new development in Afghanistan only accentuated the existing threats of terrorism and violent extremism. We must continue to work together and, with a multidimensional approach, address the root causes of terrorism. We should reinforce our efforts nationally, regionally and under the UN roof in search of solutions and mechanisms to fight this evil.  Multilateralism and the United Nations as its core and universal embodiment should be the driving force for strengthening the instruments and methods in assuring  security,  democracy, rights,  sustainable development  and  prosperity  for  all.  We  must  reinvigorate  the  effective  and inclusive multilateralism that gives the sense of joint participation in shaping our destiny.  freedom,  human In this regard, I would like to particularly stress the efforts of Secretary-General Guterres to adopt the latest report – “Our Common Agenda”, which reaffirms the core values of the organization and offers concrete proposals for a more effective United Nations, based on inclusive multilateralism. Moreover, we commend the activities of the Alliance of Multilateralism, initiated by Germany and France, and consider it a useful platform that could give e new impetus to enhanced international cooperation.  In the spirit of multilateralism, the Republic of North Macedonia will continue to fulfill its international obligations and support the work of the United Nations and its specialized agencies in creating and implementing public policies on issues of global importance.  Esteemed Excellencies,        It is well known that every crisis presents also a new opportunity. COVID- calls  us  all  to  rethink  our  attitude  towards  various  aspects  of  living.  Public health,  education  and  science  ascertained  that  they  deserve  much  more attention  if  we  intend  their  development  to  be  systematic,  integral  and sustainable.  When tackling complex and interdependent problems of the new age, we need stronger and deeper partnership and solidarity. Not only to better cope with their consequences, to restructure economies and secure further developments, but, sometimes,  to  change  the  mindset  that  holds  us  back  and  does  not  bring progress. However, human dignity should be in the focus of our efforts, both nationally and  internationally.  Eradication  of  poverty  is  only  a  starting  point  towards assuring at least the minimum rights and needs for all, while a precondition for that is for the new generations to be brought up in the spirit of more solidarity and less inequality among people.   Responsible, visionary leadership within our own borders and beyond them is a fundamental means in achieving these noble goals. We should not shy away from  our  own  responsibilities,  we  must  learn  from  our  own  mistakes  and misperceptions, caused sometimes because of our unwillingness to leave the comfort  zone  and  demonstrate  more  courage  and  leadership  determination. Moreover,  it  is  absolutely  necessary  to  hear  and  include  different  views  in decision-making. We should spare no resources and efforts in structural women empowerment, with the ultimate goal of full gender equality across all spectrums of society, be that in entrepreneurship, security, education or foreign policy.  In  this  context,  we  must  open  a  debate  on  democracy  that  is  under  threat globally and continue to actively invest in democratic values, suppressing the authoritarian  tendencies,  high-level  corruption  and  systemic  human  rights abuses. Therefore, as President of a country that knows what a different system of governance means, from the very beginning I supported President Biden’s idea of convening a Summit for Democracy in December this year.  If we want to maintain the moral superiority of democracy over other models of political  governance,  we  must  invest  in  it,  especially  among  the  younger generations. It is important for the youth to learn from our failures, oftentimes motivated by good intentions.         The old truth – that we borrow this Earth from our children practically means opening up space for their contribution, freedom and creativity. The universal education  accessible  to  all,  as  a  foundation  for  personal  development,  will prepare our youth to face modern challenges more easily and make the world a more dignified place to live in than it is today. Excellences, Ladies and Gentlemen A  broad  international  consensus  is  slowly  being  formed  that  probably  the greatest challenge of our time is climate change that we see happening every day  with  varying  intensity  and  in  different  shape.  Even  though  we  feel  the effects  of  climate  change  in  our  daily  lives,  and,  despite  the  increased awareness of the necessity to mitigate them, it seems that we, unfortunately, have  difficulties  in  mobilizing  our  strength  against  this  menace.  Horrifying scenes from across the Globe unfold in front of our eyes: the terrifying floods here in New York and in Western Europe, the series of deadly fires in South Eastern  Europe  and  the  Mediterranean  that  resulted  in  loss  of  lives  and enormous human suffering. Reaffirming our past pledges, North Macedonia remains committed to the Paris Agreement,  while  at  the  same  time  increasing  its  national  contribution incorporated into national laws and policies and regulatory measures. We look forward with great  expectation to the upcoming COP26 Summit  in Glasgow, considering it a crucial phase in our common efforts to restore the only Home we have – our planet Earth.   Dear Friends, Coming back from global to regional or national issues and dilemmas, let me say  that  the  Western  Balkans  is  facing  serious  challenges  in  the  light  of  its European  integration  aspirations.  The  current  impasse  in  that  process frustrates the citizens and constantly diminishing their enthusiasm for positive change.  On the other hand, this state of play opens the door for geopolitical competition but also for different governance models, tightening the space for democratic reforms, vital for the regional prospects of stability and prosperity. It is high time to reconsider the current phase of the largest continental project since World War II, the idea of a united, free and peaceful Europe. Is the current status of European integration in the region in line with the vision conceived by          its Founding Fathers decades ago? Should we care for a stable and prosperous Western Balkans as an important link in the continental and trans-continental stability and security, we must understand that a break-through in the European integration is an urgent need.  As  a  small  country  in  Southeast  Europe,    North  Macedonia  has  proved  its ability,  together  with  Greece,  under  the  mediation  of  the  United  Nations,  to resolve even complex issues, as the so called “name issue”’, thus contributing to additional stability in the region.  The effects of the Prespa Agreement that is now  being  implemented in  good  faith  will  benefit  both  our  countries  and  the region as a whole. At the same time, we are ready to engage in constructive dialog with our other neighbor, Bulgaria, to assure full implementation of the Good  Neighborliness  and  Cooperation  Treaty.  We  continue  to  bolster  our internal stability and development, as functioning multi-ethnic society, based on principles of democracy, the rule of law and human rights. We are indeed aware that  the  best  possible  contribution  we  can  offer  to  the  wider  stability  and prosperity lays in the enforcement of all these values, at home for our citizen.   At the end, I would like to stress that the messages we are sending this week from New York should not remain just words. Without concrete decisions today, we  will  not  make  the  world  a  better  place  tomorrow.  We  have  a  unique opportunity  and  responsibility,  as  a  generation  of  leaders  who  lead  their countries through the greatest challenges since the end of World War II, to take steps  towards  creating  a  more  peaceful  and  just  world  in  which  faith  in humanism, freedom, solidarity and respect for human dignity will be restored. I thank you for your attention.      "

100,2021,SMR,San Marino,"President, Mr. Secretary-General, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, On  behalf  of  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of  San  Marino,  I  would  like  to congratulate H.E. Mr. Abdullah Shahid on his election as President of the 76th Session of the UN General Assembly and to wish him a fruitful work.  The Republic of San Marino supports the priorities of your programme mentioned in your inaugural address and ensures you, Mr. President, full cooperation in all works of the General Assembly. I would also like to express my Country's gratitude to the outgoing President, H.E. Mr. Volkan Bozkir, for the important work carried out during the 75th Session.  I also would like to extend my special thanks to the Secretary General, H.E. Antnio Guterres  for  his  energy  and  determination  in  leading  the  United  Nations  in  these difficult and challenging times and in the reform processes of the Organization.       MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS San Marino welcomes the appointment of H.E. Antnio Guterres for a second term as Secretary-General. We offer him our warmest congratulations and full support. Mr. President,  The  COVID-  pandemic  brought  an  unprecedented  health,  economic  and  social crisis. Health systems in many countries have been driven to the edge of collapse. The Pandemic has taken  million lives. Tens of millions of people are being pushed back into  extreme  poverty  and  hunger,  erasing  the  modest  progress  made  in  recent  years. More than . billion students were out of school. Many, particularly girls, may never return  to  school,  contributing  to  a  surge  in  child  marriage  and  an  increase  in  child labour. The livelihood of half the global workforce has been severely affected.  The coronavirus did not affect the world equally. In fact, it exposed and exacerbated existing inequalities and injustices in medical assistance around the world. Fatality rates have been highest among marginalized groups in advanced economies. In developing countries, COVID- hit even harder the most vulnerable.   Knowing  all  this,  how  can  we  stay  hopeful  when  looking  at  the  economic  recovery before us? If this is how we dealt with the health emergency so far, how can we be sure that the economic policies that we are collectively called to implement in the upcoming years will not accentuate the existing gaps? One thing is for sure. If we do not address these gaps, they will aggravate our current global challenges, such as migrations, access to the labour market and to education, just to name a few, and will ultimately result into amplified geopolitical instability.  Mr. President,  San Marino paid a very high price to this crisis. We reached one of the highest rates of mortality  in  the  world.  We  finally  recovered  from  this  scourge  thanks  to  a  valuable reaction  from  our  Authorities,  who  put  in  place  policies  based  on  the  principle  of        MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS equity. We succeeded also because of an extraordinary sense of solidarity of our People and of other Countries.  Yet, even for us, being a relatively wealthy nation in the middle of Europe, this crisis represented an exceptional struggle.  San Marino enjoys relative financial prosperity and logistical capacity. Yet, just because we are a small State, we faced alarming problems in terms of procurement of vaccines. When finally we  were able  to  overcome  such problems  by  obtaining enough  vaccine doses  and  completing  a  swift  vaccination  campaign  for  our  population,  we  were actually  just  about  to  meet  a  different  face  of  inequality:  the  inequality  related  to freedom of movement.  As  you  all  know,  today  freedom  of  movement  between  and  within  countries  is  a prerogative that depends on what vaccine your Government was able to obtain. You might have thousands of antibodies and test negative for COVID, and yet not being allowed to enter a certain country, to enter a museum, or a sports centre, and so on.  You might understand why this is deeply troubling for a Country like mine, which is just  square kilometres.  This is why San Marino makes an urgent appeal to our family of Nations.  We must learn lessons from this crisis in order to fill the existing economic and social gaps and be better prepared for similar existential threats in the future.  We  must  secure  even  access  around  the  world  to  COVID-  vaccines,  tests, treatments  and  support,  in  order  to  prevent  virus’  mutations  and  new  clusters  of infections. The COVID- crisis underscored the indispensable role of international cooperation through the United Nations to overcome a shared global challenge. In  these  critical  times,  we  must  strengthen,  more  than  ever,  the  political  will  and leadership to support multilateralism and reinforce the rules-based international order.  In  this  increasingly  globalized  and  interconnected  world,  it  is  imperative  to  build  a flexible system that is able to adapt on the different peculiarities of our Countries and to react quickly to multiple challenges at the same time, to be responsive to the needs    MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS of  people, everywhere, ensuring that geopolitical  interests do  not prevail and that no one is left behind.  Mr. President,  The peace and security international context became increasingly fragmented.  The nature of conflicts is evolving due to the growing interconnections between scarce natural  resources,  climate  change,  socioeconomic  vulnerabilities,  disinformation  and cyber-attacks.  Despite our efforts, in many areas of the world vulnerable populations are still facing the threat of mass atrocities.  The Government of the Republic of San Marino is deeply concerned for the ongoing crisis in Afghanistan, Myanmar, Syria, Yemen, Palestine and elsewhere. The situation in Afghanistan is of particular concern. San  Marino  supports  any  effort  aiming  at  providing  humanitarian  assistance  to Afghanistan and calls on all  parties  to  allow full, safe, and unhindered access for the implementing  partners,  and  all United  Nations, humanitarian actors engaged in humanitarian relief activity.  its  specialized  agencies  and We  also  reiterate  the  importance  of  protecting  human  rights  including  those  of women, children and minorities.  In this respect, we cannot but support the UN Security Council Resolution 2593 and thank the  Secretary  General for having convened the High-Level Ministerial Meeting on the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan on September  and for his continuous efforts on this matter.   We  also  support  the  commitment  of  the  Secretary  General  to  strengthen  the  UN system’s ability to tackle different conflicts from a prevention-oriented perspective, as well as seeking to invest more in preventing crises.      MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS The  Government  of  the  Republic  of  San  Marino  is  worried  about  a  deteriorating international  security  environment  and  for  the  proliferation  of  weapons  of  mass destruction.  In its long history, my Country has always stood for a world free of weapons of mass destruction.  We  are  particularly  concerned  about  the  rising  nuclear  risks.  The catastrophic  humanitarian  consequences  of  nuclear  weapons  constitute  an  existential threat  to  humanity  and  for  this  reason,  the  Republic  of  San  Marino  is  a  strong supporter of the new Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Mr. President,  There is no doubt that the COVID- pandemic has endangered the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable  Development to  its  very  core. We don’t have  to let this crisis  hinder our ambitions  and  hopes,  because the  Sustainable Development Goals are essential to build back better in the post COVID- recovery.  the  principles  underpinning Last year we entered in the Decade of Action to deliver the SDGs by 2030.  Now, it is critical to accelerate responses to the world’s serious challenges.  With  the  presentation  of  its  first  Voluntary  National  Review  on  July  ,  San  Marino renewed  its  commitment  to  a better,  fairer  and  more  sustainable  world, not only  for the  benefit  of  its  citizens  today  but  also  for  future  generations,  in  our  Country  and everywhere else. Mr. President,  The  collective  fight  against  climate  change  represents  the  gravest  emergency  of  our time. This must be the top priority of our efforts.         MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS As the impacts of climate change are becoming more visible, biodiversity loss will also become  pervasive  and  ultimately  devastating.  If  current  trends  continue,  the  Earth could lose the natural wealth of its ecosystems, which would in turn jeopardize global food security, water supplies, and livelihoods. We are witnessing the grave impact of climate change on the Small Island Developing States in the Pacific, but also in other parts of the planet.  People  of  the  world,  in  particular  young  people,  demand  urgent  action  in  order  to rebuild the fundamental aspects and relationship with the environment.  We  will  be  able  to  reach  this  goal  only  through  the  full  implementation  of  the  Paris Agreement, but also by promoting important investments in adaptation and resilience.  Emerging from COVID- pandemic could represents an opportunity to work better on  the  green  transition  in  sectors  of  energy,  transport,  tourism,  aviation,  agriculture, industry and infrastructure.   Mr. President,  The  situation  for  people  with  disabilities  has  further  worsened:  the  pandemic  has deepened the difficulties in accessing education, healthcare and in participating in the life of their communities. The international community has the duty to address this situation.  San  Marino  attaches  great  importance  to  the  promotion  and  protection  of  rights  for people  with  disabilities  and  we  are  honoured  that  the  Office  of  the  High Commissioner for Human Rights has recognized as a promising practice the guidance on  triage  produced  by  the  Bioethics  Committee  of  San  Marino,  which  prohibited discrimination on the basis of disability. Realizing  the  rights  of  persons  with  disabilities  is  central  for  the  2030  Agenda  for Sustainable Development and for our promise to leave no one behind.      MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS We need to build accessible, inclusive and non-discriminatory societies, where people with disabilities can fully participate in the political, social and economic aspects of the community, where  they  are  involved  in  the  decision-making  process  and where  their value is fully recognized. Mr. President,  The United Nations must adapt quickly not only to the new global challenges, but also to the new opportunities offered by an increasingly interconnected world, in order to be more effective in carrying out its mandate. Therefore,  reforms  are  crucial  to  future  world  stability  and  maintenance  of international peace and security, and must remain at the centre of our actions.  The Republic of San Marino is following with interest the revitalization process of the UN General Assembly, which must continue to be a reference point, a forum for the exchange of ideas and for conducting discussions, in which solutions based on a strong consensus may be achieved.  Similarly, the Security Council reform should be an objective of all member States. As we  have  stated  on  previous  occasions,  our  Country  believes  that  intergovernmental negotiations favour the search for an agreement based on a broad and strong political consensus, able to reflect the interests of all negotiating groups. San Marino calls for a reform  that  makes  the  Council  more  democratic,  transparent,  efficient  and accountable. This goal can be achieved only through a continuous dialogue among the States and the awareness that overcoming the respective initial positions is essential to negotiate the broadest agreement possible.           MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS Mr. President,  To  address  the  many  and complex  challenges  of  today, Member  States  must  assume their  responsibilities  and  the  United  Nations  must  be  more  effective  and  flexible  in order to be able to fulfil its mandate, which is to protect the citizens of the world.  San Marino is a State with a strong identity thanks to its century-old history of peace and  freedom.  Our  State  is  small,  but  proud  to  bring  its  contribution  to  the  United Nations Community. Thank you for your attention.     "
101,2021,SRB,Serbia,"President,  Mr. Secretary General,  Excellencies,  Ladies and gentlemen, I have the great honor to address you today on behalf of the citizens of the Republic of Serbia.  Esteemed  Excellencies  Mr.  Abdulla  Shahid,  Mr.  Volkan  Bozkir  and  Mr.  Antnio  Guterres,  I would like to thank you for the active engagement, dedication, and leadership you have shown for the United Nations and all of humanity during these difficult times.  Serbia shares your conviction and we remain fully committed to supporting your efforts.  This year, we come together at a decisive moment in our history. Covid- has shaken our foundations to the core. At the same time, we are increasingly witnessing and experiencing the effects of climate change.  And,  finally,  we  are  seeing  significant  shifts  in  global  partnerships  and  alliances,  trade  wars between  traditional  partners  and  allies,  protectionism  instead  of  openness  and  free  market policies, and overall uncertainty at an unprecedented scale. Some of the pressing and extremely emotional issues that we have locally, in the Balkans, are still unresolved, and while we are trying – and Serbia is especially dedicated to this – to change the future by working together and creating alliances through initiatives such as the Berlin process or Open Balkan initiative, others are trying to disrupt these processes, and instead of focusing on the future, they want to recreate the past – whatever the cost of that may be.             But, let me start with COVID: The  COVID-  pandemic  has  exposed  critical  weaknesses  in  the  architecture  of  global governance. It has threatened to erase the progress many nations have achieved in recent years.  It has placed nations at a junction between isolation and collaboration, between panic and hope, between chaos and order. The pandemic questioned some of the basic tenets of the open and cooperative international order.  Global  exchanges,  international  communication,  and  cross-border  trade  have  all  seen  a  vast decrease.  Curfews, restrictions on freedom and lockdowns of entire societies have created uncertainty in many segments of the individual lives of our citizens or – for that matter – our own individual perception of what freedom in today’s world even means. For Serbia, this pandemic threatened to undermine everything we have been doing for the past  years, to crush all of the results and accomplishments of difficult reforms we initiated in 2014, and  to  propel  us  back  to  the  times  of  high  unemployment,  rising  public  debt,  uncontrollable deficit, and overall desperation. Much as in any other country, COVID- has tested our nations’ resiliency and, this time, unlike during the global financial crisis – which was of much more limited scope and incomparable in consequences to the COVID- pandemic – Serbia stood strong.  The reforms we undertook in the pre-COVID times made us more resilient than ever.          The  fiscal  consolidation,  the  budget  surplus  we  had,  efficient  and  predictable  investment environment, became a lifeline that saved us from a recession during the pandemic and one that ensured we could support our citizens and our economy during these most difficult of times. Despite the effects of the crisis, Serbia has managed to preserve financial and economic stability. In 2020, we recorded a decline in GDP of only .%  – one of the best results in Europe. Our public debt remained below % of our GDP, average salary continued to grow by almost %, while despite the pandemic the number of people employed increased by over %.  The recovery this year has been stronger than expected – our GDP will grow approximately %, and perhaps by even more. Prior to the pandemic, we have opened our borders to investment, technology, and ideas, and we managed to create a peaceful and stable environment that allowed us to pursue rapid domestic transformation, with innovation and knowledge-based economy as the foundation.   The innovative advances we had made allowed us to diversify our capabilities when the virus hit – through e-Government, online education and digital textbooks, and a central software system which drove a successful vaccination rollout.  We  invested  heavily  in  health  infrastructure  and  strengthened  the  health  system  in  order  to respond  to  the  current  crisis  and  are  eternally  grateful  to  our  health  care  workers  for  their dedicated struggle. Our decision to put geopolitics aside, and people at the center of our policies, is the reason we were able to acquire vaccines quicker than most other nations.  We did not discriminate between manufacturers, did not care whether vaccines are from the East or West, but chose to negotiate with all vaccine manufacturers deemed safe by regulators. This openness gave us the ability to purchase vaccines from around the world, giving our citizens the unique freedom to choose which vaccine they prefer.        Excellencies, Serbia believes in solidarity between nations, multilateralism and helping others when in need. Since the beginning of this year, we have made it our mission to support our neighbors, and all those  in  need,  with  COVID-  vaccines.  We  have  also  allowed  foreign  nationals  to  come  to Serbia to receive the vaccine which will protect their lives.  In total, Serbia has donated or allocated over a million doses of vaccines – 230.000 doses for the region; 300.000 doses for foreign nationals  who  came to Serbia  to get vaccinated;  and  an additional 570.000 doses for countries of Africa and Asia.  We will keep doing so, to the greatest extent possible, until COVID- is behind all of us.  That is why we have also taken steps to acquire the technology to produce at least two types of COVID- vaccines to help improve global access so we can all be safe and triumph over this virus. However, as stated by dignitaries of some of the largest nations during this General Assembly, there are other pressing issues that all of us need to keep addressing without any delay and in a bold manner – the most urgent is climate change. Serbia has redoubled its efforts to make our country safer and cleaner for its citizens, and by doing so, contribute to the fight against climate change and for environmental protection. We are strongly committed to the implementation of the sustainable development goals and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. We are committed to global efforts and will continue to work actively to meet our obligations under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.       We are about to submit our revised Nationally Determined Contributions to contribute to this critical global effort. We have already announced our intention to reduce greenhouse gasses by at  least  .%  compared  to  1990,  and  .%  compared  to  2010,  which  we  are  currently incorporating into our energy and climate strategic documents. We  work  strategically  on  planning  and  investments  in  this  sector.  These  investments  are extremely expensive, requiring years and decades of commitment and a systemic approach - but we are firmly set on the path of this transformation.  Ladies and gentlemen, Of all the challenges we face, the most worrisome for Serbia is the maintenance of peace and stability in the southern Serbian province of Kosovo and Metohija. For  more  than  two  decades,  we  have  been  constantly  drawing  international  attention  to  the problems that the non-Albanian population is facing in Kosovo and Metohija. Physical safety and respect  for  and  protection  of  human  rights,  especially  of  minority  communities,  are  far  from satisfactory.  We are now witnessing a constant increase in the number of attacks targeting Serbs, their property and religious heritage in Kosovo and Metohija.  To illustrate, there were  such incidents in 2014,  in 2016,  in 2020, and 100 since the beginning of this year. The total number of attacks in 2020 was already surpassed by June of this year.  According  to the UN,  Kosovo  and  Metohija  is  still  the  territory  with  the  least  number  of returnees (internally displaced Serbs) of all post-conflict areas in the entire world!          I will give you just a few examples to depict what the lives of Serbs in Kosovo and Metohija look like. On the 11th of May, the house of Radoje Pumpalović, an -year-old returnee to Kosovo in the village of Dubrava, in the Istok municipality, was attacked. This was the 5th attack on him in the same year. Again… he is  years old. Since June 2021, multiple attacks were carried out against Dragica Gašić, a -year-old woman, the first Serb returnee in Đakovica  years after the end of the conflict. Attacks include stoning of her apartment, banning her from shopping for food in the local store and petitions by civil society organization demanding her eviction from the city.  On the 2nd of July, in the village of Gobulji near Vučitrn, a group of Albanians attacked -year-old Nikola Perić. The attack occurred when he was returning home from the school playground with three friends.  Attacks  on  Serbian  medieval  churches,  monasteries  and  monuments  in  Kosovo  and  Metohija make them some of the most endangered cultural heritage sites in Europe.  The  Monastery  Visoki  Dečani  was  recently  listed,  by  Europa  Nostra,  as  one  of  the    Most Endangered Heritage Sites in Europe in 2021. The Advisory Panel of Europa Nostra noted that Dečani  is  the  only  monument  in  Europe  under  robust  military  protection  for  a  continuous period of   years, although  it  constitutes  a  monument  of  ultimate  historical and  cultural importance for Europe and the world. This  spiral of violence  occurring in Kosovo and  Metohija  culminated  at the  beginning  of this week.  On  the  pretext  of  enforcing  new  license  plate  rules,  Priština  dispatched  heavily  armed special  units  to  the  north  of  the  province.  This  is  yet  another  brutal  violation  of  the  Brussels Agreement, and this irrational show of force has ignited a major crisis. It disrupted the supply of  food  and  medication  to  Serb  communities  in  the  north  of  the  province.  Local  Serbs  who       peacefully  gathered  to  protest  this  measure  were  met  with  tear  gas  and  police  brutality,  thus seriously threatening local and regional stability.  Despite of all the challenges and daily provocations, Serbia remains strongly committed to finding a compromise-based solution that will ensure lasting peace and stability.  Dialogue and the implementation of the agreements reached – are the only proper way to resolve all open issues.  However,  almost    years  after  reaching  the  Brussels  Agreement,  as  the  1st  agreement  on normalization  between  Belgrade  and  Priština,  the  establishment  of  the  Community  of  Serb Municipalities – the backbone of this agreement – has not yet even begun. I would like to appeal, once again, to the international community, and especially the European Union, as the guarantor of the Brussels Agreement, to firmly insist that the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government in Priština start implementing all of the agreements reached.  The Republic of Serbia, by defending its sovereignty and territorial integrity, at the same time defends international law, the UN Charter, the legally binding UN Security Council Resolution 1244, and the supreme authority of the Security Council when it comes to the preservation of international peace and security. We  attach  special  importance  to  the  activity  of  the  UN  mission  in  Kosovo  and  Metohija  and expect it to continue to implement its mandate in the Province in accordance with this resolution.  Dear friends,          Our generation shares the common destiny of the modern world, which is becoming increasingly complex in terms of geopolitics, technology, health, and climate. In the face of these challenges, Serbia will continue nurturing international partnerships on a predictable and transparent basis. We will continue pursuing rule of law reforms on our EU path, which is our strategic foreign policy goal. We see this as inseparable from achieving sustainable peace, stability and prosperity. We will host, together with the Republic of Azerbaijan as the current chair of the Non-Aligned Movement, a commemorative high-level event marking the  60th anniversary of the First  Non-Aligned Movement Conference, which was held in Belgrade in 1961. We are very much looking forward to hosting our friends from all parts of the world in Belgrade in October this year. We will further enhance cooperation across the Balkans, through the Open Balkan initiative and Berlin process, by opening borders, harmonizing differences, and further integrating our region. In conclusion, Over the past  years, Serbia has been transformed: we sparked an economic revival, created opportunities for young people, cultivated a tech boom, and improved Serbia’s position abroad. The progress we have made has allowed Serbia to better face and survive the pandemic.  The  world  now  faces  a  turning  point.  The  recovery  from  COVID-  and  sustainable reconstruction  will  not  proceed  if  issues,  new  and  old,  are  not  handled  by  joint  forces  and collaborative international actions. This pandemic taught us one important lesson: unless all of us are safe, no one is safe – so we can either win together, all of us – regardless of how rich or poor, large or small, from Europe, Asia, Africa, America or Australia, or fail together.  But, if anything, the COVID- pandemic, as well as the issue of climate change, should have taught us to stand together.        Thank you.  "
102,2021,SVN,Slovenia,"President of the Republic of Slovenia at the 76th Session of the UN General Assembly New York, September , 2021 Mr. President, Secretary General, Ladies and Gentlemen ALMOST  ALL  the  challenges  we  face,  are  global.  The  solutions  for  them  can  be  find  only  in working together. We have a historic opportunity to steer change in a direction beneficial for all humanity. I welcome the Secretary General’s intention to hold a wide debate about our common future. We  have  to  engage  in  meaningful  discussion  and  dialogue,  even  with  those  –  or specifically  with  those,  we  do  not  agree  with.  The  culture  of  dialogue  has  dangerously deteriorated  with  the  widespread  intolerant,  offensive,  even  exclusionary  and  hate  speech.  We must  do  everything  within  our  power  to  emphasise  respect  for  and  consideration  of  different opinions and their reconciliation. It is about art of listening and speaking to others. Constructive cooperation  is  possible  only  through  a  dialogue,  and  cooperation  is  the  only  way  of  reaching peaceful solutions to all disputes. I  would  like  to  address  three  main  topics:  Covid-  pandemic,  climate  change,  and  peace  and security. First: about Covid- pandemic The COVID- pandemic is proving to be a demanding and divisive challenge for our societies. I express my deepest sympathies to all those who have suffered. And I pay respect to new heroes, among  them  medical  and  care  workers,  scientists,  teachers,  and  the  young  generations,  who struggled with limited access to education. Science has once again proved its decisive role. The pandemic has set us the greatest test in global solidarity in generations. I am proud to say that my country pledged half a million euros to COVAX and our share of donated vaccines, measured per capita, is among the highest.               Second: about the CLIMATE CHANGE Ladies and Gentlemen, The recent report of International Panel on Climate Change is alarming. It has become clear that environment  is  in  worse condition than expected. Let  me assure you, that  in  its capacity as the Presidency  of  the  EU  Council  in  the  run  up  and  during  COP26,  Slovenia  is  committed  to  the objective of Climate Neutral European Union by 2050. We will do its utmost to contribute to the success  of  the  COP26  conference  in  Glasgow.  It  is  imperative  we  move  on  climate  change mitigation, adaptation and financing in order to meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement. The IPCC report is, in fact, a final urgent call for our immediate climate action. More than ever we need  to  listen  to  scientists  and  experts. We  can  learn  from  them  and  our  decisions  will  be better. My Permanent Advisory Committee on Climate Change established two years ago, is an example of good practices. We regularly discuss whole variety of aspects of climate changes and recommend to the Government measures to be adopted. The much-needed green transition should go  hand  in  hand  with  digital  transformation. We  must  commit  to  achieving  climate  neutrality through reforms and investments in the areas of energy efficiency, renewable energy, sustainable mobility and circular business models. The effects of climate change greatly impact water, both through droughts and the floods we have witnessed this summer, and by affecting its quality. Competition for scarce water resources will intensify.  The  imminent  water  crisis  is  a  threat  but  also  as  an  opportunity  to  rethink  water innovation,  governance,  and  collaboration  on  all  levels. Slovenia  is  a  country  with  a  long tradition  of integrated water resources management  and cross-border  cooperation on water. We will  continue  to  raise  awareness  and  understanding  of  the  interlinkages  between  water  and climate change, and the importance of water for international peace and security. Mr. President, Climate  changes  profoundly  affect  food  security. For  the  very  first  time  in  modern  history,  a famine in one country - Madagascar, is attributed solely to global warming. Since 2014, Slovenia has doubled its contribution for food security. In particular through the World Food Programme for  South  Sudan  and  for  Yemen  but  also  in  bilateral  projects.  Slovenia  is  recently  helping  to ensure food and water security for children and other vulnerable groups in Madagascar through Akamasoa founded by Father Pedro Opeka – an outstanding example of fighting poverty – who over last  years has changed the lives of thousands of poor people who once lived on rubbish dumps. The Akamasoa community in Madagascar gives humanity high hopes that poverty can be eradicated. However, our efforts to fight famine need to go beyond humanitarian aid. We have to accelerate the transition to sustainable and resilient food systems. That is why Slovenia welcomes the  holding  of  the  very  first  UN  Summit  on  Food  Systems. I  see  it  as  an  opportunity  to  raise awareness  of the importance of  responsible investments  in  environmentally friendly agriculture and the prevention of food losses and waste. I  believe  the  responsible  use  of  new  and  emerging  technologies  can  help  us  deal  with  modern challenges. New  technologies  offer  numerous  opportunities  to  mitigate  climate  change,  support          sustainable  agriculture,  introduce  smarter  mobility,  offer  better  education,  and  improve  the effective use of resources – to name just a few. That is why I was delighted, to - together with the UNESCO Director-General, Mme Azoulay - officially  launch  the  International  Research  Centre  on  Artificial  Intelligence  back  in  March  in Ljubljana.  The  pandemic  has  only  increased  our  dependence  on  the  digital  space,  while  at  the same time revealed its vulnerabilities to the spread of hate speech. It is important to keep in mind that fundamental freedoms apply both online and offline. Third: about PEACE AND SECURITY The  dependence  on  digital  space  has  revealed  also  our  vulnerability  to  security  threats  and  to cyberattacks. It  has highlighted the extent of the  damage  caused by such  attacks with  regard to critical  infrastructure,  the  economy,  society  or  even  loss  of  life.  The  nature  of  conflicts  has expanded. To  enable  peace  and  security  in  all  domains,  we  should  collectively  and  more effectively  respond  to  different  crises,  which  exceed  the  capacities  of  individual  States  to react. We  should  also  more  energetically  promote  reconciliation  processes  once  peace  and security are established. The interconnected and interdependent nature of peace and security, sustainable development and human rights is more evident than ever. Covid- Pandemic has worsened the situation of most vulnerable members of our societies, children, elderly, human rights defenders. In many societies, we  face  shrinking  space  for  freedom  of  expression.  The  full  realisation  of  human  rights  for  all have proven to be key to our resilience and must be an integral part of our recovery. The situation in  Afghanistan  has  exposed  the  fragility  of  our  human  rights  system.  Let  us  never  forget  that women and children’s rights, as well as rights of different minorities, are universal human rights. Slovenia  thus  welcomed  the  Secretary-General’s  call  for  action  on  human  rights  and  supports allocation  a  higher  regular  budget  for  the  work  of  the  UN  Office  of  High  Commissioner  for Human Rights. Mr President, Following the atrocities of the Second World War we have built the international system for the promotion  of  dialogue  and  peaceful  settlement  of  disputes. The  system  is  codified  by international law and we must actively ensure respect for the principles of international law and the strengthening of international justice. This is about efffective multilateralism, which Slovenia is passionately advocating for. This is the United Nations’ finest achievement. Once again, let us work together. Thank you for your attention.            "
103,2021,ESP,Spain,"President,  Mister  Secretary-General, ladies  and  gentlemen,  Heads  of  State  and Government, ambassadors, and delegates. Last Sunday, September , at : p.m., a volcano erupted on the Spanish island of La Palma, in the  Canary  Islands.  Since  then,  all  of  Spain  is  closely  following  developments  in  the  island.  Our Government is devoted to  its inhabitants,  who see how the lava erases homes, agricultural lands, farms, fertile lands and an enormous emotional memory whose value no one can measure. I come to this Assembly directly from the island, impressed by how nature, once again, reminds us of  our  fragility.  But  also  of  our  strength.  Thanks  to  science,  we  have  been  able  to  anticipate  the answer.  And thanks to the effective and coordinated  action of our  State  and emergency  services, we have guaranteed the safety of all citizens, and we will not allow anyone to be left helpless after this natural catastrophe. During  the  last  year  and  a  half,  we  believed  that  the  whole  world  was  united  around  these  same realities:  on  the  one  hand,  our  fragility  in  the  face  of  a  virus  that  does  not  respect  borders, ideologies or social condition; on the other, a spirit of unity and confidence in science that has led us, among other things, to develop effective  vaccines against COVID- in an astonishingly short time  frame.  But  the  truth  is  that,  in  spite  of  appearances,  the  coronavirus  also  reinforced inequalities.  The  poorest  regions  lacked  the  health  infrastructure  necessary  to  stop  the  spread  of the disease, as well as the resources to create a social safety net to protect their citizens from an economic crisis. The pandemic taught us that we are all fragile, but it also reminded  us that intolerable inequalities persist in this world, which are exacerbated by global crises. Today, for example, my country is filled with hope, as we embark on a new period of recovery and transformation. We are doing this hand-in-hand with a successful vaccination campaign, which has now  enabled  %  of  our  population  to  be  fully  vaccinated.  This  amount  is  in  bitter  contrast  with countries  where  the  percentage  of  those  protected  against  COVID-  barely  reaches  %  of  the population.  This  is  the  case  of  a  country  on  which  all  eyes  are  focused  today:  I  am  referring, obviously, to Afghanistan. On August 21st of this year, together with the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, and  the  President  of  the  European  Commission,  Ursula  von  der  Leyen,  I  visited  the  first  Afghans who, coming from Kabul, arrived at Torrejn de Ardoz Air Force Base, in the outskirts of Madrid. I can assure you that I will always remember the faces of those women, men, and children, today’s victims of geopolitical strategies and conflicts mired in the past; victims of ignorance and contempt          between nations; victims of the terror associated with fanaticism and extremism; victims of the lack of  a  strong  State  able  to  support  a  free  society;  victims  of  an  unjust  and  unsustainable  model  of development;  and,  finally,  victims  of    climate  and  health  emergencies  that  we  are  currently experiencing. In other words: Those people were living witnesses to the greatest evils that threaten our planet. Undoubtedly,  we  can  observe  problems from  afar,  as  something  foreign and distant. But I believe that we are here to do just the opposite: We are here to provide common answers to needs and challenges common to all humanity. This is why, Mister President, I have come to this podium to call for three things:  I  call  for  the  defense  of  robust  States,  with  resources  able  to  guarantee  the  wellbeing  of  their citizens  according  to  the  values  of  justice,  progress,  and  equality.  We  must  promote  a  just recovery,that is capable of closing the vast gap of inequality.  I  call  for  the  defense  of  democracy  as  the  sole  alternative  in  the  face  of  any  totalitarian, exclusionary, and intolerant movement.   And I call for the defense of international cooperation and multilateralism as the only way forward to provide real solutions to the challenges that the world is facing today. These are, in my view, the three cross-cutting principles which must guide every step we take in the new times ahead of us, whose great global goals are vaccination, socioeconomic recovery, and the ecological transition.  ) Just recovery : Vaccination My  political  calling  was  born  with  a  lesson  my  grandfather  taught  me  and  which  I  have  never forgotten,  one  that  is  especially  valuable  in  these  times:  In  the  long  run,  inequality  only  creates poverty, and what is fair to everyone ends up being beneficial for all. Nothing  exemplifies  this  principle  better  than  the  dilemma  the  world  is  now  facing  regarding vaccination.  We  perceive  a  new  divide  between  countries,  which  not  only  creates  a  sense  of injustice, but which also presents a risk to global health: no one is safe until everyone is safe. Science reminds us of this time and again: Your health is our health. There are no walls or borders able  to  defend  some  from the  suffering  of  others.  This  is  why  we  must  act  immediately,  ethically, and smartly.              I would now like to announcethat Spain will increase its donation of vaccinations to third countries by  .  million  doses:  Instead  of  the  .  million  we  had  previously  pledged,  we  will  donate   million, and we will continue to raise this amount as much as we possibly can. I would like to stress the severity  of the situation in  Latin  America and the Caribbean. With % of the world’s population, it has suffered nearly % of deaths due to the coronavirus. For this reason, my  Government  has  sought  to  prioritize  support  for  this  region.  Fulfilling  the  commitment  that  I announced during the Ibero-American Summit earlier this  year, Spain has already sent more than .  million  doses  of  vaccines,  both  through  COVAX  and  bilaterally.  Of  the  remaining  .  million doses of vaccines that Spain will be donating in the coming months, I commit to send another . million  doses  to  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean.Because  in  tough  times  like  these,  Spain  must stand shoulder to shoulder with the nations with which we share so much.  Furthermore, we are going to earmark . million doses of vaccines for Sub-Saharan Africa, and for the European Union’s Southern Neighborhood. I would also like to announce that we will contribute  million euros to UNITAID, responsible for the ACT-Accelerator  Diagnostics  Pillar,  in  addition  to  the  175  million  euros  that  Spain  has  already devoted  to  the  development  and  production  of  vaccines  between  2020  and  2021,  and  to  our contributions to the Diagnostics Pillar through the Global Fund. We are going to work with countries in special need of capacity-building to tackle the pandemic. Finally, I would like to underline that patent rights can never be an obstacle to addressing this global health  emergency.  Therefore,  I  reiterate  my  call  to  resolve  bottlenecks  in  production  and distribution,  including  a  possible  temporary  waiver  on  vaccine  patents  and  the  elimination  of obstacles throughout the value chain.  ) Just recovery : socioeconomic recovery The  pandemic  has  laid  bare  another  self-evident  truth:  Only  the  exceptional  measures  and resources  mobilized  by  governments  across  the  world—each  according  to  its  possibilities—have prevented economic and social devastation of unprecedented proportions. The  Government  of  Spain  has  faced  this  emergency  from  a  very  clear  standpoint,  that  of  the welfare  state  and  multilateralism.  We  have  agreed  historic  measures  with  our  EU  partners,  and have favored a just recovery defined by the fundamental premise of leaving no one behind. It  gives  me  great  satisfaction  to  see  that  many  other  governments  are  following  this  same  path, facilitating  a  global  paradigm  shift  with  respect  to  the  mistakes  made  in  past  crises.  Without            question, it is now time to reverse the inequalities and public service cutbacks that so weakened our societies in the face of the unexpected arrival of the pandemic. I will say it once again: there is no such thing as a purely national solution. If we champion equality as  the  guarantee  of  progress  in  our  societies,  we  must  also  do  so  in  the  international  sphere, following  the  same  principle  I  mentioned  earlier:  that  of  finding  common  solutions  for  global problems. We seek to guarantee high-quality, inclusive, and equitable education, in Spain and worldwide, and for this reason my country recently announced a new contribution of  million euros to the Global Partnership for Education. We endeavor to fight poverty and exclusion in all its forms, in Spain and worldwide, reforming our development model to make it more sustainable. That is why we welcome the historic agreement on international  taxation  reached  at  the  beginning  of  July.  I  call  upon  each  and  every  country  to  join this initiative and implement the agreement as soon as possible. We seek to ensure that international financial institutions provide the financial and technical support required  by  many  developing  and  emerging  economies  at  this  precise  moment.  This  is  why  we applaud significant achievements such as the G20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative and the G20 Common  Framework  for  Debt  Treatments,  as  well  as  the  International  Monetary  Fund’s  new allocation of Special Drawing Rights. Spain  believes  that  the  G20  Common  Framework  can  also  benefit  middle-income  countries  with liquidity  problems,  in  addition,  of  course,  to  the  more  vulnerable  low-  income  countries. Furthermore,  we  support  the  creation  of  a  tool,  in  the  framework  of  the  International  Monetary Fund,that  would  enable  advanced  countries  to  channel  Special  Drawing  Rights  to  vulnerable countries,  without  taking  into  account  their  level  of  income,  so  that  they  can  finance  the  reforms necessary for their sustainable recovery and combat climate change, poverty, and inequality. Spain stands ready to make a suitable contribution to this instrument, once it has been approved. We must now ensure that the initiatives underway have the greatest possible impact, soonest. Let me  be  clear  on  this  point:  The  2030  Agenda  continues  to  guide  us  in  achieving  the  Sustainable Development  Goals.  The  pandemic  has  dealt  a  harsh  blow  to  our  expectations,  but  it  has  also strengthened  our  conviction  that,  now  more  than  ever,  this  is  an  unrelinquishable  and  necessary goal.  ) Climate emergency Mister President,            I have previously referred to overcoming the pandemic and to socioeconomic recovery. But, without question, the climate emergency is the overriding crisis of our times. There is no room left for denial. The reality of climate change  is something  we  witness on a daily basis,  and  the  consequences  are  increasingly  catastrophic.  Major  wildfires,  chronic  droughts, floods,  and  unprecedented  weather  events  are  diminishing  our  resources,  dramatically  changing our way of life, and causing irreversible loss of biodiversity. Once  again,  we  are  addressing  a  common  problem  with  common  causes  that  call  for  shared, multilateral  responses  at  the  highest  level.  In  this  regard,  I  am  proud  to  say  that  Spain  and  the European  Union  are  leading  by  example,  and  represent  the  bloc  of  countries  with  the  most ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions. One of the main challenges of COP26 is to step up our ambition in terms of climate financing and, in particular, in terms of adaptation. We must honour the commitments adopted on the basis of the Paris Agreement and significantly raise the bar for future commitments. Spain will contribute to this goal by allocating  million euros to the Adaptation Fund in 2022, and we will work to ensure the success of the Glasgow COP26. The time to act is now. We can afford no delay. It is  also the time for us to agree on a new  world framework for the protection  of biodiversity  that goes beyond the goals set for 2020. In this regard, I would like to mention that this year is the 30th anniversary  of  the  Madrid  Protocol  on  Environmental  Protection  of  the  Antarctic  Treaty.  This Protocol  represented  a  major  step  forward  in  protecting  the  Antarctic  environment  and  its dependent  ecosystems.  Next  October  ,  an  international  conference  will  be  held  in  Madrid  to analyze the achievements of these past  years, and to reflect on the challenges that lie ahead. Spain  has  made  the  climate  crisis  an  absolute  priority  of  its  Government  action:  %  of  the investments envisaged in our Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan will be allocated to the ecological transition. By 2030, % of the electricity we generate, and % of the total energy we consume,  will  come  from  renewable  sources.  And  we  have  just  recently  approved  an  ambitious Climate Change and Energy Transition Act. Decisive advances  will only  be achieved through the  concerted efforts of States. But we must not forget to place people at the heart of our decision-making, to ensure that there are no winners and looser. Because ecological transition entails radical changes that will have a very direct impact on people, on their jobs, and on consumer habits. This is why we are not only leading a Just Recovery project  to  overcome  the  economic  crisis.  We  are  also  committed  to  a  just  transition.  This commitment stems from our absolute conviction that this is the most effective way of achieving new levels  of  progress  and  wellbeing.  Allow  me  to  offer  a  very  clear  example:  Spain’s  Integrated          National  Energy  and  Climate  Plan  envisages  that  our  ecological  transition  policies  will  create between 250,000 and 350,000 net annual jobs. Once again, what is just for all, always ends up being beneficial for all.  ) Regional challenges and commitments to multilateralism Mister President, Our  response  to  these  three  factors—the  pandemic,  the  economic  crisis,  and  the  climate emergency—will  undoubtedly  determine  and  shape  short  and  medium  term  international  policy. Spain will remain active and committed in this process: ) Firstly,  we  are committed  to Latin America and the  Caribbean, a region  with  which  we have very close  ties.  This  year  is  the  30th  anniversary  of  the  first  Ibero-American  Summit,  an  anniversary  in which  we  must  consider  both  the  immense challenges  caused  by  the  pandemic,  and  the  internal displacement  of  hundreds  of  thousands  of  people.  This  situation  is  straining  the  social  support systems  of  several  of  the  region’s  countries  to  their  limits.  Spain  believes  that  a  comprehensive approach, that addresses causes, and not only consequences, is required.  Spain wishes to maintain its role as the principal agent strengthening the EU’s ties with Latin America and the Caribbean, and we are convinced that doing so will bring shared stability and prosperity to both sides of the relationship. )  Secondly, we are committed to the Mediterranean. We share a destiny a destiny that necessarily must  be  one  of  opportunities,  prosperity,  regional  integration,  and social  inclusion  with  its  coastal countries. To this end we must ensure peace and stability and resolve existing conflicts. As established in the Security Council resolutions, a just, lasting, and mutually acceptable political solution  must  be  found  for  Western  Sahara.  Spain  continues  to  champion  the  central  role  of  the United Nations and we support the Secretary- General’s efforts. This year, major steps have been made towards achieving stability in Libya, a process, which must be led by the Libyans themselves, and which Spain fully supports. Holding elections at the end of the year must be the goal. )  Thirdly, I would like to highlight that Spain has a new policy for Africa, a continent with immense potential. We wish to support Africans in their own search for prosperity and progress, and are firmly convinced that Africa’s progress will also be our own.              My country is committed to the efforts to ensure that security and peace return to the populations of the Sahel. Stability in this region is essential to preserve the security of our citizens, on both shores of the Mediterranean. )  Fourthly, Spain has not forgotten about the frozen conflicts. This autumn is the 30th anniversary of the Madrid Peace Conference which brought the Arab nations and Israel together for the first  time, giving  rise  to  the  peace  negotiations  that  resulted  in  the  Oslo Agreements.  Peace  talks  must  be resumed so that progress can be made towards the two- State solution. As regards Afghanistan, we will have to learn to work within this new situation—and especially with its neighboring countries—to address the humanitarian crisis and prevent greater destabilization in the region. We must not lower our guard before the threat of terrorism, which already struck a harsh blow  during  the  evacuation  missions.  Afghanistan  cannot  be  allowed  to  become  a  new  refuge  for terrorists. In  short,  Spain  is  firmly  committed  to  the  search  for  international  peace  and  security.  We  have deployed  men  and  women,  including  both  civilians  and  service  people,  in  the  United  Nations missions in Lebanon, Mali, the Central African Republic, and Colombia. We are present with NATO in Iraq, the Baltic States, and in the Mediterranean. Moreover, we contribute more than % of the European Union’s military forces abroad, participating with particular intensity in the Sahel, a clear commitment to the development of a greater strategic autonomy of the European Union and to the strengthening of our Common Security and Defense Policy. On  December  31st  2020,  in  the  context  of  the  United  Kingdom’s  withdrawal  from  the  European Union,  Spain  and  the  United  Kingdom  came  to  a  bilateral  understanding regarding  Gibraltar.  This understanding must serve to lay the foundations for the future relationship of this territory with the European  Union,  and  we  trust  that  an  agreement  may  soon  be  reached  between  the  European Union  and  the  United  Kingdom  regarding  Gibraltar.  This  agreement  must  fully  respect  United Nations’ doctrine regarding said territory, with which Spain is fully aligned. It must also respect the legal position of my country as regards sovereignty and jurisdiction concerning Gibraltar. Our goal is to work towards creating an area of social and economic prosperity that encompasses the entire area of Gibraltar and Campo de Gibraltar. The  defense  of  an  international  order  based  on  rules  and  institutions  is  a  strategic  priority  of  the Government of Spain. We demonstrated this a year ago when, together with the Prime Minister of Sweden, I launched an initiative with a group of countries from different parts of the globe ready to exercise their leadership to support multilateralism, and strengthen it with specific responses.          Since then we have been working together to fulfill the commitments undertaken in the Declaration on  the  Commemoration  of  the  75th  Anniversary  of  the  United  Nations.  We  are  grateful  to  the Secretary-General for his efforts in presenting his report on “Our Common Agenda”, and we commit to strive for its fulfillment. History  has  taught  us  that  no  country  can  achieve  any  major  milestone  from  a  unilateral, individualistic  position,  isolating  itself  in  the  midst  of  a  globalized  world.  The  enemy  of multilateralism  is  extremism;  let  us  not  allow  ourselves  to  be  deceived  by  those  espousing selfishness and individualism, those who would have us believe that the collective causes uniting us are causes that do not merit our efforts. In this context, one of ever-shifting balances in a multipolar world, the European Union must take on its corresponding leadership role, and it must do so with strength and decisiveness. This has very specific  implications,  beginning  with  the  need  to  develop  greater  strategic  autonomy,  and  to strengthen our security and defense policy. I would also like to underline our readiness to strengthen the Atlantic Alliance and to adapt it to the global  challenges  of  today  and  of  tomorrow.  Spain  will  work  with  a  spirit  of  commitment  and determination  to  ensure  that  the  next  NATO  Summit,  which  will  take  place  in  Madrid  in  2022,  will produce a new strategic concept that affords the Organization the  instruments and mechanisms it needs to tackle the challenges of the coming decades.  ) Ending: defending democracy Mister President, I began my address by referring to the hundreds of Afghans who reached Madrid last August 21st, thanks to the joint efforts undertaken with our EU partners and with NATO. I  do  not  mention  it  triumphantly;  rather,  I  do  so  as  a  reminder  of  all  those  people  who  in  some remote corner of the globe remain  unjustly trapped, persecuted and threatened by the enemies of progress and tolerance. In the face of such tragedy, those we managed to evacuate might seem few. Undoubtedly. But let us not forget that they are human beings, full of dreams, desires, and capabilities. In short, human beings  just  like  us,  who  have  been  given  a  fresh  opportunity  to  carry  on  with  their  lives.  They encourage us to continue working on the behalf of others.  I think especially of the girls and  women who have  played such a vital role  in the development of Afghanistan  in  recent  years.  The  very  future  of  women  teachers,  women  lawyers,  and  women            journalists is at risk in today’s Afghanistan. We must place the rights and freedoms of thousands of women  and  girls  at  the  forefront  of  our  priorities,  because  no  society  that  allows  only  half  of  its population to move forward, and purposely keeps the other half behind, is sustainable. And  I  would  also  like to call attention to the plight of the almost  million  Afghan children  whose survival depends on humanitarian aid, as UNICEF has reminded us. The food crisis suffered by the country  resulting  from  the  drought  has  worsened  and  borders  on  a  monumental  humanitarian catastrophe. Preventing this must be our foremost priority right now. The  crisis  in  Afghanistan  has  led  some  to  question  the  way  in  which  certain  countries,  Spain included,  participate  on  the  international  stage.  In  response  to  such  doubts,  I  would  like  to  assert here  today  that  democracy  is  the  only  form  of  government  that  guarantees  the  defense  and protection  of  human  rights  and  of  individual  freedoms  and  that  it  will  continue  to  be  the  compass and the guiding light of our action. We will continue to defend our belief that every human society, in every corner of this planet, should be  free  to  live  in  accordance  with  the  basic  principles  of  freedom,  dignity,  social  justice  and participation,  respecting  established  laws  and  the  will  of  the  majority,  as  well  as  the  rights  of minorities. Respecting a code that is above that of any other nature or identity: that of human rights. Because Afghanistan is not the only scenario in the fight for democracy. This fight is being waged in every  continent,  including  in  the  world’s  most  developed  countries.  It  is  a  daily  struggle  against those  who  would  impose  inequality,  benefitting  a  select  few;  those  who  seek  to  exclude  or  to  lay blame at the feet of the most vulnerable minorities; those who incite hatred on the grounds of origin, sex, or belief; those who call for walls and borders to keep at bay the ideas of equality, freedom and fraternity. Without  question,  democracy  is  threatened.  We  must  be  aware  of  this.  Democracy  is  not  a  gift bestowed  upon  us;  but  rather  the  bounty  of  a  hard-won  historical  conquest  that  we  must  cherish and protect. At  this  time  in  which  history  seems  to  be  speeding  up,  a  time  of  profound  changes  in  the  global order, of new ways of growth and of inhabiting our world, I ask that we step up our commitment to democracy and engage in this common project shared by millions of human beings, that continues to welcome us all on equal terms. There are no racial, cultural, historical, or anthropological grounds for mutilating freedom. And this is why democracy is the only way forward.          There is no question that  democracy is the most effective system for improving people’s lives, for increasing their prosperity, and for creating opportunities for all. Democracy needs no explanation or justification. This is why, begging your indulgence, I will finish these words with a quote from a great Spanish Socialist politician of the first half of the last century, Fernando de los Ros. When asked: “Freedom for what purpose?” he simply replied: “Freedom to be free.” Thank you very much.      "
104,2021,AUT,Austria,
105,2021,BEL,Belgium,"President, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, How encouraging to see the General Assembly meet in person again.  When I stepped into this solemn hall I felt a sense of relief.  Don’t we all yearn to get “back to normal”? But is this sense of relief justified?  And what is the “normal” we can hope for?  Can we feel relieved when COVID- is still all around us  and too many people are not vaccinated? Can we be relieved when, for a growing number of people, climate change is becoming a matter of life and death? Is there room for relief when human rights are being challenged in so many places? All over the world, people who are perceived as ‘different’ are confronted with hate speech and hate crimes. With discrimination and abuse.           And can we REALLY feel relief when the “new normal” for women and girls in Afghanistan, is to go home, keep silent and stay inside?  No, we cannot.  Let me quote Secretary-General Daog Hammergeuld, who was murdered exactly sixty years ago last week: “the weakness of one is the weakness of all, and the strength of one is the strength of all.” That is why Belgium remains strongly committed to multilateralism,  to an international order based on the rule of law, the founding principle of our United Nations. Only through common action will we build common strength. Only through multilateralism, will we provide long-term answers to today’s complex crises. Which vulnerabilities, then, require our common action?   I see three. * * * The first vulnerability is COVID-.  We need to bring this pandemic to an end.           It is now almost two years since our lives were turned upside down by an unprecedented health crisis.   I would like to express my deepest appreciation to health care workers in Belgium and elsewhere who continue to battle this deadly virus.   Belgium is among the top vaccinated countries in the world: eighty-five percent of our adult population is fully vaccinated. But Belgium is also a leading exporter of vaccines, accounting for two thirds of all European exports.  We are one of the world’s vaccine powerhouses and we acted like one, by keeping trade lanes open and exporting over 530 million vaccines to the rest of the world, without ever imposing an export ban. If we are to overcome this pandemic, vaccine solidarity is a crucial condition, since no one will be safe until everyone is safe.  It is therefore un-accep-ta-ble that today less than four percent of Africa’s population is fully vaccinated. As Hammergeuld said: the weakness of one is the weakness of all. As long as the virus continues to circulate, the risk of new variants is there, and no one will be safe. COVAX is the best mechanism to strengthen vaccination solidarity and close the global vaccination gap. Belgium has already donated . million doses, and by the end of the year, we will donate a total of four million vaccines. With close to three billion euro pledged to COVAX, the European Union is one of its major donors.        But we must do more.  We must also boost local vaccine production, through technology transfer and sharing of knowledge. That is one of Team Europe’s objectives. At least ONE billion euro will be invested to this end.  And as we speak, a Belgian private company is working with partners in Senegal to start local vaccine production. // We also must prepare for the next pandemic, even if the present one is far from over. A new pandemic treaty will allow us to be better prepared // build resilient health systems // and increase access to decent health care and quality medicines. AND we need a transformed World Health Organization that is ‘fit for purpose’ to lead these efforts.  // The coronavirus took the lives of nearly five million people. But it also had a devastating impact on our Agenda 2030. It halted and even reversed many of the recent, positive developments.  Extreme poverty is on the rise again for the first time this century.  Economies were pushed into recession.  Fragile countries were struck harder than others.          Yet, giving up is not an option.  As the Secretary-General said in his report “Our Common Agenda”, we should “usher in // a new eera of universal social protection”.   Not ONE country can cope with these unprecedented challenges on its own.  That is why ‘Team Europe’ is pooling efforts and resources to assist the most vulnerable countries. Belgium is proud to be part of this collective European effort. So, let’s not loose courage.  YES, we MUST build back! But we are faced with an important choice – an opportunity even: do we continue with business as usual or do we do things differently? * * * (FRENCH BEGINS) Cela m’amne  une deuxime vulnrabilit qui requiert notre attention : la crise climatique et l'urgente ncessit de placer la durabilit au cœur de tous nos efforts.             Le rapport publi le mois dernier par le Groupe d'experts intergouvernemental sur l'volution du climat est sans quivoque : l'augmentation de la concentration de CO2 et de la temprature mondiale est sans prcdent.  TOUTES les rgions du monde sont maintenant tmoins des effets nfastes du drglement climatique, et PLUS RAPIDEMENT que prvu. Cet t, l'Europe et mon pays ont t durement touchs par des conditions mtorologiques extrmes.  Ce sont  de nos compatriotes qui ont perdu la vie lors de ces inondations, les pires qu’ait connu notre pays.  Notre nation tait sous le choc. // Face  la brutalit des forces de la nature, nous tions nombreux  nous sentir tout petits. Nous allons reconstruire. Mais ce ne sera pas suffisant.  Nous ne pouvons pas nous croiser les bras et attendre les prochaines inondations, la prochaine vague de chaleur ou la prochaine scheresse extrme qui tuera  nouveau.  Nous devons AGIR et nous devons le faire MAINTENANT. (FRENCH ENDS)            This makes the UN Climate Conference, COP26 in Glasgow, the MOST IMPORTANT meeting of recent years. With the Green Deal, the European Union intends to be climate neutral by 2050 and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by AT LEAST % by 2030.  We hope that MORE COUNTRIES will follow Europe’s ambitions. This transition to sustainability is not only a cost. It is also a major economic opportunity. It triggers innovation and drives new growth.  It is the future our YOUTH demands. That’s why Belgium will double its wind energy capacities in the North Sea, to remain one of the global leaders in offshore-wind-energy-production.  We will increase investments in renewables. AND we have the clear ambition to become ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT hubs in clean hydrogen supply. Our common mission in Glasgow is crystal clear: we need to do ‘WHATEVER-IT-TAKES’ to limit global warming to the Paris target of one and a half degrees. Building the resilience of the most fragile countries will be an important part of this effort. That is why we must deliver on our financing commitment of 100 billion dollars and why Belgium plans to increase its contribution to international climate finance. It is // quite literally // a matter of life and death.          If we fail to act on the climate crisis, we will not only lose more lives, but global tensions, instability and insecurity will increase. * * * This brings me to the THIRD vulnerability: our inter-national security. Twenty years ago, the attacks of /11did not only change this city. They changed the world.  Five years ago, my country was also attacked by terrorists. Like France, we are bringing terrorists to justice. But we have NOT defeated terrorism yet.  Terrorists continue to claim innocent lives, as they did recently at Kabul airport. Belgium is one of the founding members of the Coalition against ISIS. We actively participate in the fight against terrorism. With military deployment and with stabilization and reconstruction efforts through UNDP.  Throughout the Sahel, our bilateral cooperation encompasses both defence and development. Indeed, security is not sufficient to ensure stability. And we cannot close our eyes to the aggravating humanitarian situation. The failure to prevent conflict often results in the failure to protect human dignity, with people losing everything.  My country is a MAJOR humanitarian donor.            Belgium’s budget for humanitarian aid was 200 million euro last year.  During our Security Council tenure, we attached great importance to humanitarian issues, such as humanitarian access to Syria.  In the same vein, we will continue to help the Afghan people with humanitarian aid. Belgium will do its part, in line with our commitment announced last week in Geneva. // The world can-NOT turn its back on the Afghan people.  Yes, humanitarian assistance is necessary and needed to save lives. But only tents and food will not be enough.  I see an important role for the United Nations in remaining close to the people of Afghanistan. To provide humanitarian assistance. But EVEN-MORE to prevent the country from imploding.  Turning our back on the Afghan people, would come at a high cost. A population plunged into extreme poverty, will fall victim to extreme ideologies or will do everything to leave the country. * * * Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,          These three vulnerabilities, health, climate, and security, are a threat to human rights and their universality. For Belgium, peace, security and development are not possible without a profound respect for human rights. In EVERY crisis, in EVERY war, women and girls suffer FIRST and suffer MOST.  We are concerned by the appointment of a Taliban government that does not reflect the political, religious and ethnic diversity of Afghanistan.  Afghan women and girls are already bearing the brunt. They are tear-gassed, beaten, dismissed, locked up at home. We will continue to monitor their rights. They must be able to go to school, to work, to live their lives in freedom.  Societies where women are respected and equally represented, where they thrive and can become teachers // society leaders and CEO's, are stronger and more stable societies. // Twenty years ago, Belgium played a crucial part in the adoption of the Durban Declaration and Program of Action. The fight against racism is of paramount importance to my government. Racism, antisemitism and ALL OTHER forms of discrimination and intolerance, are unacceptable.  We NEED to challenge and END racial injustice.  In doing so, we will shape a society that lives up to the promise of the fundamental equality of all human beings. The universality of human rights is         the CORNERSTONE of the modern international order. It is an ESSENTIAL obligation for ALL STATES.  That universality is all too often questioned. More than ever, we need to reaffirm that human rights are not a favour.  They are an obligation.  Everywhere.  For everybody. Too many women and girls still fall victim to human rights violations.  Same-sex relationships are still considered a criminal offence in TOO many countries. Belgium will continue to be a voice for LGBTI people.  We will NOT let our guard down.  For all these reasons, Belgium aspires to become a member of the Human Rights Council for ‘-‘.  * * * Mr. President,              These global vulnerabilities threaten the very fabric of our societies, our ways of life. They can only be addressed by a COLLECTIVE ANSWER, based on a dynamic multilateralism.  “No one is safe until everyone is safe”.  That has become our guiding principle in fighting the pandemic. It is the present-day translation of Hammergeuld pointing out that the weakness of one is the weakness of all. “No one is safe until everyone is safe”.  Let this be our common objective when it comes to climate, security and human rights as well.  Let THAT GUIDELINE inspire our actions every day. I thank you.       "
106,2021,FRA,France,"President of the General Assembly,  Secretary-General,  Heads of State and Government,  Heads of Delegation,  By reminding us of the extent to which our destinies are linked – for better and for worse – the pandemic crisis has reminded us of the value of what has united us at this organization for over  years. The will to cooperate, the primacy of law over force, unconditional respect for the human person: the principles of our Charter have not lost any of their meaning. In fact, quite the opposite. Today’s crises and challenges have made them even more essential.  Our security, our health and our planet are now common goods, which together we must strive to preserve. This imperative is not abstract, it is not an ideal.  It is, in very concrete terms, the perspective of each of our choices.  And just as definitively, it is our punishment each time we are divided, each time we give up, each time we are powerless. Because in a world of exchanges and interdependencies, a world with environmental emergencies, a world facing worrying attitudes of brutalization and the constant temptation of unilateralism, everything that we do together – and conversely, everything that we fail to do – involves us all. We must be aware of this and learn lessons from it. Together. Although the foundations of the multilateral system have remained solid in the face of attacks in recent years, too many uncontrolled risks are building up. On behalf of France, my first message to you today is thus one of responsibility. Our first shared responsibility is to maintain international peace and security.  And it is in danger when power games are heightened, when bloc mentalities reappear, when our regulatory frameworks collapse, when attempts at fait accompli policies increase. That is why France is calling for a P5 Summit to set out a joint action programme. To enable the Security Council to fully exercise its mandate. And to start dialogue on the key issues of arms control and our collective security. And that is why we are taking action and will continue to do so for peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific with our willing partners in the region and other Europeans alongside us. As an Indo-Pacific Page  sur      nation, France has major interests in the region, as does Europe which has just set out a strategy in this area. International peace and security is thus at risk each time a crisis breaks out or reaches a new level. In Afghanistan, our duty is to provide the people with necessary humanitarian assistance and it is in our common interest to have clear political and security requirements with regard to the regime in Kabul: all links with terrorist organizations must be severed.  Twenty years after the events of September , we know what a rebuilt haven for terrorists would mean for us. In the Levant and the Sahel, we must, for the same reason, continue to fight the terrorist threat, work to restore dialogue where it has broken down and give the people new prospects for the future by working towards stability and development. Recently, the President of the French Republic, Emmanuel Macron, travelled to Baghdad to support the Iraqis’ determined efforts to come together and restore their sovereignty.  In the Sahel, we are adapting our military structure to retain our long-term action capabilities, to meet the expectations of our regional partners and to remain fully available to our international partners, those from the Coalition for the Sahel and those serving within MINUSMA. These efforts, which are producing real results, as can be seen by the recent killing of Abu Walid Al-Sahrawi, are not sustainable without political stability and respect for the democratic process. I particularly have in mind the timetable for elections in Mali, which must be strictly observed. In Libya, there is now a credible path to restore unity and sovereignty in the country, provided that all parties fulfil their obligations, the foreign mercenaries withdraw, the ceasefire remains in place and elections are held as planned on  December.  France hopes that the Security Council, Libya’s neighbours and those which have influence over the country can collaborate to achieve our shared objective of completing the ongoing transition.  This is the aim of the international conference to support the political process and restore sovereignty in Libya, which we will host in Paris on  November. Whether in the divided Middle East, along the contact line in Ukraine, in Nagorno-Karabakh or the South Caucasus, where the risk of conflict still cannot be ruled out, we must prevent tensions, uphold international law and collectively support the implementation of concrete political solutions. With regard to the Iranian nuclear programme, we must be absolutely unequivocal. Iran cannot be allowed to think time is on its side, because the more dangerous its nuclear programme becomes, the greater the risk of a major crisis.  The positions taken by the United States yesterday cannot justify Iran’s continued violation of its JCPOA commitments.  Page  sur   France will take all necessary action to encourage dialogue. But the only possible path remains an agreement to establish that Iran is once again fulfilling its obligations. It is therefore essential that negotiations resume very quickly. Violations of international humanitarian law also constitute a serious threat to international peace and security.  Particularly when humanitarian and medical personnel are targeted, even as they are providing emergency relief to populations. We must therefore equip ourselves with the means to better prevent these crimes and punish those who are guilty of committing them – in Syria, Yemen, Niger, the Central African Republic, Ethiopia and everywhere else. Our responsibility – ladies and gentlemen – is also to build pragmatic and inclusive responses to the major global challenges that determine our shared future.  Starting with the COVID- challenge which is not yet behind us. We need to be very clear: the health of some depends on the health of all. We must therefore pursue efforts that, through the ACT-A initiative, have already provided 255 million vaccine doses to 141 countries. We cannot allow the vaccine divide between the North and the South to widen any further.  Because the very meaning and credibility of multilateralism is at stake. And because we know that if immunity is not global, there will be no immunity.  There is an urgent need to accelerate deliveries to ensure that each vaccine delivered is administered properly and to strengthen our production capacities on all continents. France will continue to work in close cooperation with its partners, especially those in Africa.  Our commitment to provide  million doses will be achieved by the end of the year.   And we are proud to contribute to the financing of a project to transfer technology to South Africa, which should help Africa develop autonomous production capacities of mRNA vaccines. International solidarity must also prevail when it comes to the other challenge of the pandemic crisis: the challenge of economic recovery. A response to the emergency was provided with the debt deferment initiative that we took at the G20 and the establishment of a common framework that can now be used for its implementation. But we must go further by building a new pact with Africa that President Macron called for at the Summit on the Financing of African Economies in May 2021.  The G20 must commit to ensuring that the allocation of special drawing rights we decided upon in the IMF is swiftly supplemented by the reallocation of a portion of them to countries which need them most. Page  sur    France is ready to transfer % of its SDR allocation to African economies to strengthen the resilience of societies and support the transition to a sustainable development model and meet our objectives for the climate and the environment.  The environmental emergency must be at the heart of each of our future choices.  Without succumbing to fatalism, because the IPCC experts have told us that if we swiftly lower our emissions, we can still limit warming to  or even .C. We must act urgently, but it is not too late! However when we act it must be with no half measures, because - as the Secretary-General has firmly stated – we are now on a catastrophic pathway due to insufficient commitments that are leading us to global heating of .C for which we will all, without exception, pay a heavy price. COP26 which will begin on  November will therefore be a moment of truth. Each of us must shoulder our responsibility and provide a contribution that is commensurate with what is at stake. Namely human lives, international stability, and the future of the generations to come. We must rally around the objective of climate neutrality by 2050 before it is too late. Here again, France will show its solidarity by providing € billion a year and devoting more than a third of its financing to climate adaptation.  This fight for the climate must go hand in hand with the fight for biodiversity.  In Marseille at the IUCN World Conservation Congress, held in early September, we made strong commitments, that we must now implement, particularly the symbolic project of the Great Green Wall for the Sahara and Sahel. We must also put climate finance to work for biodiversity, as the connections between the two topics are now well recognized. During this time of global economy recovery, we must lastly ensure that our trade practices are fully compatible with our international solidarity efforts and our climate and environmental objectives. By providing new levers in accordance with WTO law, such as the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism that we wish to establish in Europe to fight carbon leakage, in the same way that we wish to fight imported deforestation and violations of social rights across our value chains. And by working, at the same time, on a tangible “greening” of the multilateral trade framework at the WTO ministerial meeting this year, starting with an ambitious agreement for regulating fisheries subsidies. The future of our oceans depend on it. We also have a responsibility with regard to the very principles of multilateralism, of which we are the guardians. The responsibility, first of all, to preserve our ability to act in the name of these principles and promote a truly multilateral order.  In this regard, Secretary-General, I would like to commend your action and your efforts to inject new impetus into the United Nations system. We will work by your side throughout your second term. Page  sur   While supporting our collective institutions, including in their reform efforts, we must also continue to develop project multilateralism.  That of the Alliance for Multilateralism, which we launched two years ago with my German colleague and which was able to play its full role from the start of the pandemic.  And the International Alliance for the Protection of Heritage in Conflict Areas, which is doing an outstanding job in Iraq, Syria, Mali and Afghanistan, in cooperation with UNESCO. We have the responsibility to defend these principles where they are wavering. In Afghanistan, where the achievements of the last  years cannot be erased. Particularly when it comes to the access to education and the rights of women and girls. And everywhere where the universal scope of human rights is being challenged.  Because universal human rights are the first political and legal translation of the unity of humankind, without which this organization, our organization, would have no foundation. This is a commitment – I would like to recall – that the United Nations Member States freely consented to sign and respect. These principles that unite us, we have the responsibility to keep them alive today, by upholding them up to and including the digital realm. We have seen increasingly irresponsible behaviours flourish, without managing, unfortunately, to provide an international normative response to regulate them and to ensure that the rights and freedoms of all are respected. The introduction of a minimum universal % tax for multinational companies will help achieve this. We therefore call on all States to support this vital measure. France and its European partners even intend to adopt actual legislation on digital markets. We encourage our international partners to follow us down this path, and we invite them to work with us to establish a new digital public order in the wake of the Paris Call and the Christchurch Call to Action, which, since 2019, has enabled us to take decisive action to remove terrorist content from the Internet.  Collective responsibility in international peacekeeping and security; shared responsibility in tackling today’s major challenges; responsibility of each of us with regard to what unites us: for France this is what the historic turning point we are experiencing calls for. We must all rise to the challenge. While our country is preparing to take over the Presidency of the Council of the European Union in the first half of 2022, you can – ladies and gentlemen – count on our determination to fully assume our share of this three-pronged responsibility.  Engaging us in all the security, solidarity and equality combats.  To rebuild, with you, our shared world. Thank you. Page  sur   "
107,2021,CHE,Switzerland,"President of the Swiss Confederation Guy Parmelin ""Cultivating a resilient world like a vineyard"" Speech for the General Debate of the 76th United Nations General Assembly New York,  September 2021 Unofficial translation                     Mr President of the General Assembly,  Mr Secretary-General of the United Nations, Heads of State and Government, Excellencies,  Ladies and Gentlemen,  For most of my professional life, I have been a winegrower. Winemaking has taught me  patience,  perseverance  and  confidence.  A  vine  takes  years  to  grow  and produce. Improving grape varieties is a subtle science to produce the best wines. You have to respect nature and work in tune with it.  Why am I talking to you about this here in the sanctuary of the United Nations? The COVID- pandemic is a bit like hail or frost that can suddenly ravage vines: unexpected and destabilising. Good winegrowers live with this risk and know how to recover from such twists of fate.  The pandemic is a human, social and economic catastrophe that is also affecting international peace and security. Our thoughts are with all the victims, direct and indirect. The  pandemic  has  made  us  realise  that  we  must  anticipate  future  crises,  be prepared to deal with them and show solidarity in order to build a resilient world.  Too often we get carried away by short-term thinking and the prospect of rapid gain. We need to rediscover a sense of anticipation and the awareness that fate may strike  at  any  moment.  What  will  happen  next?  Scientists  work  to  identify  future threats  and  alert  us  to  them.  They  also  provide  us  with  information  and  data  as elements  of  the  solution.  The  proper  management  of  this  data  is  of  paramount importance. This is why Switzerland is proud to be hosting the next UN World Data Forum in Bern in October. We know the risks, we must be prepared for them and invest in prevention. We must provide ourselves with the means to achieve this. Research, education and vocational training, especially for girls and women, must be at the heart to develop access to knowledge, promote innovation and enable action. More broadly, access to knowledge and skills gives us the keys to anticipate and prepare for our future.  When hail or frost strikes, Swiss winegrowers help each other, and they call on the insurance funds which they have paid into. When a crisis affects entire regions, or even  the  planet,  solidarity  must  be  global  and  solutions  common.  The  United Nations is the place where knowledge and resources are pooled. The organisation itself arose from lessons learned from past crises. Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,                Let us continue to defend rules-based multilateralism. Switzerland is committed to  an  effective  and  efficient  United  Nations  and  supports  reforms  aimed  at improving  conflict  prevention,  strengthening  the  UN  development  system  and modernising  management  methods.  Switzerland  has  much  to  contribute  to  the challenges facing the world. Twenty years after joining the United Nations, we are ready to contribute to the work of the UN Security Council for the 2023/ term. The COVID- pandemic has accentuated existing protectionist tendencies and highlighted resilience shortcomings in global production and supply chains. Policies to promote reshoring and investment controls are therefore gaining momentum. With  the  continuous  acceleration  of  our  economic  processes,  made  possible  by technological change and digitalisation, our societies have become complex.  As the adverse weather and fires of recent months around the world have painfully reminded  us,  it  is  clear  that  the  climate  is  being  disrupted  as  a  result  of  human activity, and human action is also putting pressure on the biodiversity of our planet.  Power  rivalries  are  worsening  and  armed  conflicts  are  raging  on  almost  every continent. International humanitarian law and human rights are violated on a daily basis, and this sows the seeds of future conflicts.  It  is  our  responsibility  to  find  answers  before  we  hit  the  wall.  The  2030  Agenda already  gives  us  the  framework  we  need  to  achieve  this  goal.  In  view  of  these challenges, Switzerland would like to emphasise five points:  First,  in  order  to  defeat  the  pandemic,  we  must  ensure  that  vaccines  are accessible to everyone in the world. Switzerland is committed  to ensuring fair and  affordable  access  to  vaccines,  treatments  and  diagnostics.  Our  country contributes to the Vaccine Alliance and supports the COVAX AMC initiative for low- and middle-income countries with USD 155 million (CHF 145 million). As the host country  of  several  international  health  organisations,  including  the  World  Health Organization,  Switzerland  provides  resources  and  promotes  reforms  that  enable effective action in this area.   Second, the crisis has revealed the interdependence of our modern societies and the importance of international value chains, particularly in essential goods. We need to strengthen their resilience without resorting to protectionist measures that threaten  global  economic  recovery.  The  legal  framework  for  international  trade must work to enhance legal certainty and predictability even in times of crisis. The World Trade Organization has a key role to play here. Third, technological developments and digitalisation offer solutions to many of the challenges we collectively face. In Switzerland, there is close cooperation with universities and the private sector to find innovative technological approaches for development  and  poverty  reduction  projects.  Yet  there  are  risks  involved.  The virtual world is not a lawless zone. In the General Assembly, Switzerland works to promote  responsible  state  behaviour  and  the  application  of  international  law  in cyberspace.  It also  participates  in efforts to combat  cybercrime.  Geneva  plays  a role as a global centre for digital policy and networking for the actors involved.               Fourth,  let  us  take  climate  change  seriously.  As  the  latest  report  of  the Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  shows,  human  activity  can  still determine  the  future  course  of  climate.  I  will  personally  be  present  at  COP26  in Glasgow  to  reaffirm  Switzerland's  commitment  to  the  effective  and  consistent implementation of the Paris climate agreement. At the national level, Switzerland is committed  to  achieve  climate  neutrality  by  2050.  It  is  implementing  concrete initiatives, such as infrastructure projects that promote the modal shift from road to rail. I call on all countries to aim for climate neutrality by 2050 at the latest and to submit  ambitious  climate  targets  for  2030.  Switzerland  is  also  committed  to  the preservation of biodiversity. Fifth,  in  a  polarised  world,  it  is  more  important  than  ever  to  return  to  dialogue. Switzerland's  International  Geneva  traditionally  provides  a  neutral  platform  for discussion. Earlier this year,  one of the events it hosted was the Libyan Political Dialogue Forum (LPDF), which resulted in the appointment of a Unified Executive Authority  –  a  first  for  the  country  since  2014  –  which  is  tasked  with  preparing national  elections.  Switzerland  is  very  concerned  about  the  plight  of  the  Afghan population. It welcomes the humanitarian conference on Afghanistan convened by the  Secretary-General  last  week  in  Geneva.  Switzerland  is  also  working  hard  to promote international law, including humanitarian law, in order to avoid conflicts or reduce  their  effects.  Switzerland  is  proud  to  have  prepared  its  report  on  the implementation of international humanitarian law. I call on all UN member states to do the same. Such reports enable states to  assess their good practices and the challenges to be faced.  Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, Hail and frost will continue to ravage the vines in my country from time to time. Our world will continue to face crises in the future.  Let  us  create  the  means  to  face  them  together,  in  a  spirit  of  cooperation  and solidarity. Let's work to make the world ever better educated, more innovative, more resilient and more just. Let's be inspired by Saype’s land art, “World in Progress II”, currently on display on the North Lawn. Let's take a cue from the two children building the world as they imagine it. And let us cultivate this world of ours, as I have learned to tend my vines.            "
108,2021,AUS,Australia,"President, It is a pleasure to give Australia’s National Statement to the General Assembly. Here in Canberra, I’m on the ancient land of the Ngunnawal people — one of Australia’s many Indigenous peoples who have cared for this continent for ,000 years. Our First Peoples remind us that caring for country — and for each other — is the essence of our shared humanity. The past year has been one of extraordinary adversity, as the world has struggled and dealt with the COVID- pandemic — and it continues to rage. Yet it has also borne witness to humanity’s remarkable resilience and creative ability to overcome problems; to deliver solutions. Each generation navigates its own destiny amidst anxiety and hope. Ours is no different.   Today, I would like to speak about three of the most pressing global challenges that together we face. Challenges that shape our times. .      The global COVID- pandemic and economic recovery     Mr President, COVID- has tested the world like nothing in our lifetime. We mourn the millions lost. And millions more who have suffered such terrible illness. After so much heartache and so much sorrow, there is hope now and a way forward. The development of a safe and effective vaccine — vaccines, so many of them — has been one of the greatest achievements of modern times. Our collective task though now is to roll that out — a global vaccine rollout, the largest in world history. Here in Australia, more than  per cent of our adult population has had the first dose of the vaccine, and more than half will have had two doses. We know vaccinations work. They lower the risk of transmission. They significantly lower the risk of hospitalisation, severe illness and death. And high vaccination rates are the pathway to taking back so much of what we have lost, and to living with this virus — confidently, safely, securely and prosperously. Vaccinations are the key to keeping our neighbours safe also. Australia  has  been  helping  countries  across  our  region  battle  this  pandemic  —  with personal protective equipment, testing equipment, medical personnel. And now we’re doing everything we can to help them with access to safe and effective vaccines. None of us are safe unless all of us are safe. So this is the most urgent priority for Indo-Pacific nations. Already, we’ve delivered more than three million doses to countries across our region — and millions more doses are on their way.  We’ve also contributed $130 million to the COVAX Advance Market Commitment, which has delivered over  million doses to Southeast Asia and . million doses to our Pacific family and Timor-Leste. And  we’re  investing  more  than  $620  million  to  procure  millions  of  vaccine  doses,  and providing  technical  advice,  training  of  health  workers,  and  cold  chain  support  to  our friends and our neighbours. Now this includes a $100 million contribution to the Quad Vaccine Partnership with  our good friends the United States, India and Japan. This will support a boost in production by at least one billion doses by the end of 2022, and provide access to vaccines and delivery support to countries across the Indo-Pacific. This is the right thing to do. It will help slow the spread of the virus — and, we hope, prevent variants emerging. As well, we must prevent future pandemics and Australia supports the calls for a stronger, more independent World Health Organization, with enhanced surveillance and pandemic response powers. This should be the duty of every single member of the World Health Organization to share that  ambition  for  a  World  Health  Organization  that  can  seek  to  protect  us  all  in  these circumstances. And we also need to accelerate efforts to identify how COVID- first emerged. Australia called for an independent review, and sees understanding the cause of this pandemic, not as a political issue, but as being essential, simply, to prevent the next one. We need to know so we can prevent this death and this calamity being visited upon the world again. That can be our only motivation. .      Strategic competition in the Indo-Pacific region Mr President,   COVID- has underscored the vital importance of international cooperation and coordination. The patterns of cooperation that have sustained our prosperity and security for decades — they’re under increasing strain. And so are the institutions that have helped maintain that rules-based international order for over seven decades now. The global strategic environment has rapidly changed, indeed deteriorated in many respects, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region where we live here in Australia. The changes we face are many … … whether it’s tensions over territorial claims … … rapid military modernisation … … foreign interference … … cyber threats … … disinformation … … and indeed, economic coercion. Meeting these challenges requires cooperation and a common purpose among like-minded nations, and all who share that purpose of peace, stability and security — to enhance these as the outcomes that benefit all peoples from wherever they come and whatever their perspectives. Australia’s interests are inextricably linked to an open, inclusive and resilient Indo-Pacific. A region where the rights of all states — no matter how large or how small — are protected. This is what we believe. Australia continues to work constructively on this goal — with agency and purpose and commitment, passionately building a network of partnerships and relationships that support these goals, contributing to. With our Pacific family — through the Pacific Islands Forum.   With our ASEAN friends — very much at the heart of our own Indo-Pacific vision. Through the Quad, with a practical agenda for peace, contribution and security in our region.  With our many bilateral strategic partners — comprehensive strategic partners. And with our longstanding friends and allies — the United States and the United Kingdom. Strengthened of course further last week with the announcement of our new Enhanced Trilateral Security partnership — AUKUS. Designed to further the cause of peace, stability and security in the Indo-Pacific region for the benefit of all who live within that region. It is essential that countries pursue these interests in ways that are mutually respectful and support stability and security. Because we want to maintain an open, rules-based international system that supports peace, prosperity, human dignity and the aspirations of all sovereign nations. A global order where sovereign nations can flourish, free from coercion, because of collaborative and purposeful action. Enables them to correspond and engage in a fellowship, that is supported by a rules-based order. Rules that have underpinned regional peace and prosperity, such as through the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which we affirm as Australians and which we will always honour. We must reinforce a sustainable rules-based order … … while ensuring it is also adaptable to the great power realities of our time. The United Nations must continue to reinforce the international rules-based order, and preserve the institutions that uphold that order and ensure they’re effective, as the mechanisms, the dialogue and adjudication that buttress and hold together this all-important order. Australia also values the rules and institutions that foster international trade … … which creates wealth and brings nations together …  … and is vital to our recovery from the economic costs of this pandemic. .    The challenge of climate change & transitioning to a net-zero global energy economy Finally Mr President, Australia is determined to play our part in meeting the global challenge of climate change, as the world makes the transition to a net-zero global energy economy — a new energy economy. Australia has a proven track record when it comes to setting, achieving and exceeding our commitments to responsibly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We exceeded our Kyoto commitments. Our emissions in the year to March 2021 were  per cent below 2005 levels. That is a strong record of achievement. And it’s been achieved by Australians right across our community — our businesses, individual households, small businesses, our institutions, our governments. In Australia, we already have the world’s highest uptake of rooftop solar. And we’re deploying renewable energy at nearly eight times the global per capita average. We are well on the way to exceed our 2030 Paris commitment of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by  to  per cent below 2005 levels. We will meet it and we will beat it — and we’ll beat it strongly. And we are committed to achieving net zero emissions. My Government, the Australian Government, will release our Long Term Emissions Reduction Strategy ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow at COP26. We know the world is transitioning to a new energy economy. It’s no longer about if — or even when for that matter. It’s about how.   How we achieve the reduction in global emissions — in our own emissions, in individual nations’ emissions — while still lifting living standards across all nations. And the answer, as history has shown us time and time again, it’s technology — practical, scalable and commercially viable technologies. That’s why we’re investing around $ billion to commercialise promising new technologies like clean hydrogen, green steel, long duration energy storage and carbon capture — vital to meeting the global task to achieve net zero emissions. And we want to work with everyone, other countries, to commercialise these technologies, and ensure they’re scalable and accessible, as soon as possible.  This is critical for the good of developing countries, who we all know face the steepest challenge in reducing their emissions.  Developing countries need job-creating investment in the same productive, commercial technologies, energy technologies, available to advanced economies, like Australia. Australia is a reliable partner during this time of transition.  We know that if we can support developing economies to embrace and use the technologies that achieve net zero emissions, and see their economies grow and increase their jobs, that is not only wonderful for those economies and their peoples, but it also is good for Australia. We know that their success will also be our success. And so we are blessed here in this country with natural resources, including transition fuels, and the resources needed for the new energy economy.  And we will apply them. We will apply them in our region as we continue to work with our Southeast Asian partners and to assist them make their energy transitions successfully through finance, through trade and capability building.  We have one global atmosphere — and it’s in our shared interests to work with each other in this way. That’s why we’re helping other countries reduce their emissions and build resilience to climate change, too.  It’s why we’ve set aside $. billion in practical climate finance globally — and it will have a particular focus on our Pacific family, dealing directly. We’re up for this global challenge. We’re up for achieving net zero emissions — a challenge that we know will be met in partnership. And that unless we all get there — well, we will not achieve our goal. .      Australia’s liberal democratic values Mr President, Australia has always sought to make a positive contribution to meeting global challenges. Our voice is clear, it’s direct, it’s respectful, it’s constructive. It reflects our confidence in who we are and what we stand for. We are a proud, liberal democracy. We believe in a world order that favours freedom — an order that was established through the fine institution of the United Nations that we gather around through these contributions and that supports the dignity and free expression of all people. We believe in human rights, in gender equality and the rule of law — and we back that up with how we pursue these things in our own country, in our own society, and how we raise our own children. Australia was one of eight countries only involved in the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. And we continue to strengthen the international human rights system. And we will continue to raise our voice on important issues like the rights of women and girls, the rights of Indigenous peoples, the global abolition of the death penalty. Because respecting the rights and freedoms of the individual is intrinsically important — it is fundamental to our values as a people and as a nation.   It lifts all societies and nations, too — delivering better outcomes through economic inclusion, women’s empowerment, environmental sustainability, rising living standards, and so much more. Australia’s actions are guided by our belief in the inherent dignity of all people. Everywhere, no matter the circumstances. Mr President,  We learned through the pandemic that every moment of challenge requires us to think anew, to engage with each other, to learn as you go. It is an experience understood by many others. And so we will continue to meet this moment, with dialogue, with partnership. Thank you, Mr President. [ENDS]   "
109,2021,NZL,New Zealand,"President,  Mr Secretary-General,  Friends,  I greet you in te reo Māori, the language of the indigenous people of Aotearoa New Zealand.  As I deliver this address to the General Assembly from here in New Zealand, it strikes me that even when global events threaten to disconnect and divide us, a shared instinct to connect with one another, still prevails.  I have often described New Zealand as being remote, but connected. The COVID- pandemic has made both parts of this statement truer than ever. In some ways, we now feel that remoteness more keenly. The vast ocean surrounding our islands have taken on an even greater significance in a time when our border controls are our first line of defence against a highly contagious, global virus.  Despite this physical distancing, the pandemic has demonstrated more starkly than ever just how closely connected we all are. We live in a world where domestic decisions made half a world away, are as significant to us as those made by our nearest neighbours.  In many ways, COVID- is an illustration of global transboundary problems at a local level. Here is an invisible threat, which no one is safe from, and the very thing keeping us safe – is each other. We have placed our trust in the actions of neighbours and strangers – to wear masks, to distance, to get vaccinated and support others to do so, and we live collectively with the consequences.  It has been a privilege for me as a leader, to witness the practical application of New Zealanders’ values to these challenges.  Values like manaakitanga and whanaungatanga, which in the Māori language mean kindness, and a shared sense of humanity and connectedness. Values like kotahitanga, or a shared aspiration and unity towards a common goal.  These values have seen New Zealanders take care of one another, and work together to limit the transmission of COVID- in our communities.                        Now these values are not unique to New Zealand. They are universal. They underpin the Charter of the United Nations. One need only read the preamble to see them reflected back at us. No community, nation, or region acting alone can address COVID-. It is a complex, global problem that requires a global solution. Equitable access to safe and effective vaccines for everyone is essential to our response and recovery.  New Zealand is working with others, especially Australia, to support full vaccine coverage for Pacific island countries. And the COVAX Facility is doing essential work distributing vaccines worldwide. But more must be done to support this effort. New Zealand is proud to have been amongst the first countries to donate doses to the COVAX Advance Market Commitment in addition to our financial support.  New Zealand continues to work in WTO and APEC to support a waiver of intellectual property protections for vaccines and other measures to increase availability. Without equitable access for all, we risk further variants developing which could undermine or undo our progress.  At the same time that the direct impacts of COVID- have brought immeasurable pain to many across the world, it has also exacerbated and further complicated other existing global challenges. We know what these challenges are. We articulated them as areas of action in the UN Seventy-Fifth Anniversary Declaration. The pandemic has been the ultimate disrupter. It has changed our realities, and given us cause to pause and reflect. In the disruption is an opportunity for us to reset. To adjust some of our fundamental settings to put us in a better position to respond to our shared challenges.  We have heard so much about ‘building back better’. We must do better. Like the drafters of the Charter, we owe future generations our commitment to hand down a better world forged through cooperation.  Fortunately for us, we already have a blueprint for such a world in the Sustainable Development Goals, and the 2030 Agenda. The 2030 Agenda recognises that as our shared challenges are interconnected, so too must be our responses. As we face a series of interlinked global crises that demand action, now is the time for us to recommit to the SDGs. COVID- cannot be an excuse for not achieving the SDGs. In fact, it’s a further reason why we must.  There is perhaps no better example of a global crisis that demands action than climate change. Climate change is one of the most pervasive crises of our time.  From rising sea levels to shifting weather patterns, the impacts are global in scope, unprecedented in scale, and happening right now.                  Climate change touches all of our lives, but countries in the Pacific are some of the most affected, despite having contributed least to the problem. Pacific leaders view climate change as the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and wellbeing of the peoples of the region.  Any global response that fails to limit global warming to . degrees above pre-industrial levels is unacceptable. This is our goal, and our collective efforts must achieve it. The latest science from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is stark.  The climate crisis cannot be beaten through incrementalism. The science demands that we do so much more.  New Zealand has made the . degree limit the heart of our domestic climate change legislation. We have committed to a 2050 target and we are revising our Nationally Determined Contribution.  As we mitigate, we must also adapt. This year New Zealand conducted its first national climate change risk assessment to tell us where to focus our effort, and within two years we will have a national adaptation plan. But we have already begun our journey. New Zealand has a programme to plant for instance, one billion trees by 2028. This will store carbon, but it will also support forest resilience, prevent erosion, improve biodiversity, and support our rural and indigenous communities. Lifting the ambition of our nationally determined contributions is vital, but there are also collective actions we need to take.  This includes bringing an end to fossil fuel and other environmentally harmful subsidies. It includes pooling our resources and knowledge through the Global Research Alliance so that we can grow more food without growing emissions. It includes negotiating an agreement on climate change, trade and sustainability. New Zealand is actively pursuing all of these outcomes.  We must collectively address the unjust and potentially destabilising consequences of climate change.  For Small Island Developing States, one of the gravest consequences is sea-level rise. The ocean is central to the culture and livelihoods of the peoples of the Pacific. Pacific countries have also planned their economies and long-term development in reliance on the maritime zones and resources guaranteed to them under the Law of the Sea Convention.  It is only right that as an international community, we work to ensure the maintenance of those zones and rights in the face of climate change-related sea-level rise.  As a contribution to this objective, I was pleased to join my fellow Pacific Islands Forum Leaders in issuing the ‘Declaration on Preserving Maritime Zones in the Face of Climate Change-related Sea-Level Rise’, in August this year.                Climate change is closely interlinked with another crisis of a planetary scale – that of global biodiversity loss.  As much as we are all interconnected as nations, so too are we connected with nature and the services it provides. We depend on it for the air we breathe, and the economies we have built. Biodiversity loss threatens our well-being, our prosperity, and our health. It will both accelerate climate change, and make its impacts worse.  This is a challenge that requires us to work across barriers and silos. For New Zealand’s part, we have adopted the Aotearoa New Zealand Biodiversity Strategy 2020 – Te Mana o te Taiao – which will guide our actions domestically for the protection, restoration and sustainable use of biodiversity. We simply cannot achieve the 2030 Agenda unless we unite with collective ambition to reverse biodiversity loss by 2030. We have an opportunity to do this by adopting and implementing an ambitious and transformational post-2020 global biodiversity framework at the upcoming Conference of Parties. New Zealand is committed to this, and I urge you to join us.  As with biodiversity on land, ocean biodiversity is equally important. New Zealand looks forward to concluding the negotiations on an UN treaty for the conservation and sustainable use of high seas biodiversity. But as we turn our mind to the challenges we face globally, we must turn to the most important thing of all – he tangata, he tangata, he tangata – it is people, people, people.   More than 120 million people have been pushed into extreme poverty as a result of the COVID- pandemic. Inequality within and between countries has deepened.  These consequences were never inevitable, and there are steps we can take to reverse these trends and improve the lives of those impacted.  Too many people go hungry every day. New Zealand invests heavily in sustainable food production, and what we produce feeds many times our own population. But we have seen that at the global level, food systems are neither sustainable nor resilient. They suffer from, and contribute to, the overlapping impacts of climate change and biodiversity loss. Transformational change is needed to ensure that everyone has access to the nutrition they need. This week’s Food Systems Summit is an important step, and it must be the beginning of an ongoing effort. We will do our part in supporting these efforts, including on initiatives that acknowledge the leadership of indigenous peoples in food systems and increase global ambition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. For our part – this is an area where we are working hard, with a unique agreement between our food sector, government and Māori to reduce agricultural emissions through a pricing mechanism.  We are determined to show the world what is possible.                  At the same time we must include making trade more open and inclusive. COVID- disrupted global supply chains, while at the same time it illustrated the importance of open trade to protecting the health of people and lifting them out of poverty and hunger. We must commit to ensuring the flow of essential goods and services, and reject any temptation to turn inwards and focus on protectionism.  We know that poverty and inequality drive conflict and instability, and we are also seeing this, in heightened civil unrest and conflict. Humanitarian crises have worsened. We are seeing this in Afghanistan and there are many more. As an international community we must rise to the challenge of meeting the growing humanitarian need. But we also have to intensify our efforts to prevent conflict and build peace. New Zealand looks forward to playing a part in this effort as we join the Peacebuilding Commission in 2022.  As leaders, we have a responsibility to foster and sustain peace in our societies. We know what the necessary conditions are. Yes, this includes the absence of poverty, hunger, and material deprivation. But it is also something more. Peaceful societies are inclusive societies, where diversity is embraced and everyone has both the means and the opportunities to contribute to the fullness of their potential. Where women and girls are lifted up and encouraged to exercise their voice and their agency.  Whatever our political or constitutional systems, no nation will ever be truly peaceful in the absence of these basic conditions, founded on the fundamental and equal rights of every person.  And where peace fails, we must all do our part to strengthen and improve respect for the laws of armed conflict, and to enhance the protection of civilians. Preventing both the use of illegal weapons, and the illegal use of legal weapons, is essential, as is ensuring there is no impunity for any such use. This work is a shared responsibility, and one which we pursue alongside our tireless efforts to rid the world of nuclear weapons and the spectre of a conflict that no one can recover from. All of these challenges we share might cause us to re-examine our response to being so interconnected. We have a choice. To approach our shared challenges from a place of fear, hoping to protect narrowly defined interests by turning inwards. Or we can reaffirm our trust in cooperation, understanding that our greatest fears can only be tackled by concerted collective action.  Our forebears were once at this fork in the road. They chose the path of trust. They founded the United Nations. It is times like these when we have the most to gain by reminding ourselves of what the Charter’s preamble says. It speaks to a concern for future generations. It speaks about universal observance of human rights, respect for international law, and living together in peace as good neighbours. It speaks about uniting our strength, and combining our efforts to accomplish our aims.               These words of determination were in response to the devastation of war. They apply equally to the collective challenges we face today, and if we are to resolve these in an enduring way, we must look beyond government. Inclusive multilateralism is one in which our common understandings are enriched by diverse perspectives. As governments, we owe it to ourselves to be open to the expertise and partnerships offered by stakeholders, whether they are from civil society, industry, or indigenous groups.  I have seen in the progress we have made through the Christchurch Call to Action, what can be achieved when governments, industry, and civil society work together in a multi-stakeholder capacity to eliminate terrorist and violent extremist content online, and I am utterly committed to further efforts on this important work.  New Zealand is committed to advancing Our Common Agenda, and sadly, as we have seen in recent times, an essential element of this is preparedness.  No one can argue for instance that the global community as a whole was adequately prepared for a global pandemic. It is clear that we will face further global health risks, and we have no excuses for remaining unprepared.  New Zealand strongly supports the ambitious and practical approach of the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response. We will not just passively support the Independent Panel’s recommendations. We will actively engage on work streams to develop a pandemic treaty, convention or other international instrument; to improve global surveillance, validation and early response; and importantly, to strengthen the World Health Organisation.  If there is any lesson we can draw from the events of the past  months, it is the need for more, and better, cooperation. And with the need for better cooperation, comes the need for responsive and adaptive global institutions, including the United Nations.  I commend and thank the Secretary-General on his report and recommendations to advance Our Common Agenda. These provide us with a roadmap for a more inclusive and effective multilateralism. One that includes a voice for the needs of future generations and leaves no one behind.  As leaders, we have the power to shape our shared institutions and to make them fit for purpose. We must not shy away from this task. I can think of no better way to reaffirm our kindness towards one another, our shared humanity, and our unity.  I hope you will join us.  Tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā tātou katoa.              "
110,2021,FJI,Fiji,"President of 76th Session of UN General Assembly, Abdulla Shahid; Secretary General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres; Excellencies; Ladies and Gentlemen Page  of             Bula Vinaka from Fiji.  I’ve  just  stepped  away  from  a  session  in  our Parliament –– the beating heart of our eight-year-old true parliamentary democracy. I wish I could be with you in New York, but I am beholden to Fiji’s shores to lead our COVID- response.   Allow  me  to  first  congratulate  you,  Your Excellency  Abdulla  Shahid,  on  your  election  as the President of the General Assembly. The Fijian people  ––  the  stewards  of  .  million  square kilometers of Blue Pacific ––are proud to see the Maldives,  another large  ocean  state,  offer Presidency to the international community. Page  of      And  to  my  friend,  Secretary  General  Guterres, congratulations  on  your  second  term.  Your  re-election was a win for the planet, for the climate, and for the smallest states among us.  Our multilateral challenges: UN : Your  Report  to  the  UNGA  on  Our  Common Agenda is the blueprint for a future that is better, greener, and  safer  –– and I would humbly  add, “bluer.” We  want  that  future  for  Fiji.  We  want  islands inhabited by citizens who stand with nature and not  against  it.  We  want  sustainable  economic growth  that  is  powered  by  clean  energy  and protected from the impacts of climate change.  Page  of     We want robust and resilient health systems, and we want good jobs and income supported by a green and blue economy. To succeed, our vision must become the vision of humanity, because our fate is the world’s fate.  The  world’s  present  course  leads  nowhere  near the  future  we  want  for  ourselves.  A  deadly pathogen  is  burning  through  humanity  like  a bushfire  ––  and  inequity  is  fanning  the  flames. This year alone, climate-driven floods, heatwaves, fires,  and  cyclones  have  killed hundreds  and  inflicted  unsustainable  economic damage.  We  humans  are  the  cause,  but  we  are refusing to become the solution.  Page  of     This grave moment is not without parallel. In the wake of the death and destruction of World War Two,  world  leaders  saw  unilateral  action  as kindling for another world war, one fought with nuclear weapons of  planet-destroying potential. They answered that challenge with the genius of this multilateral system.  Our  challenges  are  different,  but  the  stakes  are alike.  Mr. Secretary General, your recommendations  in  Our  Common  Agenda  are spot on. We must meet this moment with a new UN  ––  a  new  energy,  new  resources,  and  new bonds  of  trust  with  the  people  this  institution serves.  A  new  UN  that  enlists  the  dynamism  of young people, because our action –– and inaction –– directly affects their future.  Page  of    A new UN that empowers those on the margins of society –– particularly women and girls –– and brings  them  into  the  centre  of  global  decision-making.  Excellencies, Since we last gathered, it has become clearer that we face two pandemics –– one that is ending for the  wealthy  nations  and  one  that  is  worsening across  much  of  the  developing  world.  That widening chasm can be measured in lives lost and in years of economic progress undone.  Across  the  Global  South,  what  the  world  once branded  as  “sustainable  development” is unraveling before our eyes.  Page  of     Hundreds  of  millions  of  jobs  have  been  lost, hundreds  of  millions  of  people  cannot  access adequate food, and an entire generation has had their  education  disrupted.  The  wounds  of  this crisis will cripple us for years if left untreated.    Fiji’s  experience shows  how  an  equitable recovery  can  begin.  It  starts  by  getting  jabs  in arms, fast.  After one full year with zero local COVID cases, the insidious Delta variant crept into our country and  sparked  a  deadly  second  outbreak.  After  a slow start while we scrambled to acquire enough vaccines, we are winning the battle.  Page  of      Over  %  of  adults  across  our  110  populated islands  have  one  jab  of  the  vaccine,  and  more than % are fully-vaccinated. We thank India, Australia, New Zealand and the United States for helping us secure the doses we needed.  Our  mission  now  is  to  recover  the  more  than 100,000 jobs lost to the pandemic and to recoup a  %  loss  in  Government  revenues.  Soon,  Fiji will  reopen  to  tourism  and  to  regional  and international business. We will look to accelerate investment trends, like increased digitization, that will modernize our economy and help it recover.  But Fiji’s victory over the virus will be short-lived                                         unless  the  global  community  can  accelerate vaccinations everywhere.  Page  of     It is appalling that wealthier countries are already considering  third  doses  or  boosters  for  their citizens  while  millions  of  people  –  including frontline healthcare workers - in the developing world  cannot  access  a  single  dose.  Globally, thousands of lives are still being lost every day to the  virus.  The  majority  represent  our  collective failure to make vaccines available to developing countries.  Vaccine nationalism must end. The G7, G20, and multilateral  financial  institutions  have  failed  to stop  it.  Only  the  UN  can  fill  this  void  of leadership.  Page  of      I  join  other  leaders  in  calling  on  the  UN  to convene an urgent special meeting of Leaders to agree to a time bound, costed, and detailed plan for the full vaccination of developing countries.  Our Socio-Economic challenge  Vaccine inequity is a symptom of a much larger injustice, one that is inherent to the international economic  system.  This  injustice  is  the  unequal distribution of finance, or access to finance, that can fuel a recovery.  Page  of         While  wealthy  nations  have  propped  up  their economies  by  printing  and  investing  trillions  at near  zero  interest  rates,  developing  nations  –– particularly Small States –– have had to borrow at punitive rates to simply keep our people alive, fed, and healthy. Through  the  pandemic,  my  Government  rolled out  the  largest  cash  transfer  program  in  our history  –  providing  hundreds  of  millions  of dollars in unemployment benefits to nearly one-third  of  Fiji’s  adult  population.  We  even expanded some  of  our social  protection programs, including pensions for the elderly, and financial  support  for  the  differently-abled  and other vulnerable communities.  Page  of    The  alternative  was  mass  destitution,  which  we would  not accept. But to pay for  it, we had to take on debt, precipitated by massive reduction in Government revenue. We  need  a  more  innovative  framework  for development  finance  that  recognises  the  unique needs  of  SIDS.  And  we  must  adopt  a  more sophisticated framework  of  assessing  debt sustainability  that  incorporates  the  urgency  of building  resilience  and  breaks  free  of  the  norms of the 20th century.     This  pandemic  has  been  a  painful  lesson  about where unilateral action can lead and where our multilateral institutions are unwilling to go.  Page  of     We must find new frontiers of co-operation if we stand any chance of averting future pandemics ––  or  staving  off  the  worst  of  climate  change.  If Small States are to build back greener, bluer, and better,  we  will  need  an  equal  voice  about  and vote  on  decisions  that  determine  our  future. Small States need our interests heard, understood, and acted upon.  Our Climate Challenge Despite all the talk we hear of saving the planet, the  world’s  collective  commitments  are  paltry. Akin  to  spitting  into  the  strengthening  winds  of climate-fueled super-storms.  Page  of      The climate is on track for . degrees Celsius of global warming, which would ensure the loss of entire  low-lying  nations  in  the  Pacific  and  huge chunks of global coastlines. It guarantees frequent devastation from floods,  cyclones,  coastal inundations, and wildfires. It spells climate-driven conflict, mass migration, and the collapse of food systems  and  ecosystems.  It  is  appalling.  It  is unimaginable. But it is where we are headed.  Since  March  2020,  Fiji  has  experienced  three cyclones  –  two  of  which  approached  Category Five  intensity.  Fijians  are  strong  people.  We endured much, and we will endure more still. But I am tired of applauding my people’s resilience. True resilience is not just defined by a nation’s grit but by our access to financial resources.  Page  of    Resilience  is  seawalls.  It  is  parametric  insurance for  those  most  vulnerable.  It  is  nature-based solutions. It is systematically relocating communities  from  the  rising  seas.  Fiji  is  using every fiscal tool in our kit to do these things. And we  are  doing  everything  within  our  means  to reduce  our  emissions.  We  have  submitted  an NDC that commits Fiji to net-zero emissions and harnesses  nature  to  lead  that  transition  –– commitments that will soon become law through a  comprehensive  Climate  Change  Bill. In recognition  of  the  ocean-climate  nexus  ––  Fiji hopes to secure a blue bond next year in support of a sustainable blue Fijian economy. But Fiji can’t halt climate change by itself.  Page  of    Today, SIDS are able to access less than  percent of the available climate finance. To build a truly resilient  Fiji,  we  need  access  to  fast-deploying targeted grants, long-term concessionary financing  and,  financial  tools  and  instruments established  through  public-private  collaboration and partnership.   Our Oceans Challenge  The Fijian economy depends on a healthy ocean and  so  we  are  taking  bold  strides  to  reverse  its current  decline.  We  have  committed  to  100 percent  sustainable  management  of  EEZ  and   percent  declared  as  marine  protected  areas  by 2030.  We  are  expanding investments in sustainable  aquaculture,  seaweed  farming,  and high-value processed fish.  Page  of    But  we  cannot  do  this  alone.  We  look  to  the global  system  to  stop  illegal,  unreported,  and unregulated  fishing.  We  look  to  Member  States to  agree  to  a  new  treaty  to  preserve  marine  in waters  beyond  national  jurisdictions.  We  need global  greenhouse  gas  emissions to fall dramatically and quickly.  At  COP26, we expect the  oceans  pathway  will  be  locked  into  the UNFCCC processes. Fiji seeks a decision in “one slash COP ” reflecting this change. Our COP26 Package  In one month, we meet in Scotland for a hugely consequential  COP.  The  Pacific’s  mission  in Glasgow  is  clear:  we  must  keep  the  .  target alive.  Page  of    This demands drastic emissions cuts by 2030 that put  large  nations  on  a  path  towards  net-zero emissions before 2050.  Leaders  who  cannot  summon  the  courage  to unveil these commitments and policy packages at COP26  should  not  bother  booking  a  flight  to Glasgow. Instead, they –– and the selfish interests they stand for –– should face consequences that match the severity of what they are unleashing on our planet. We do not tolerate war between our Members  States.  So,  how  can  we  tolerate  war waged against the planet, on the life it sustains, and  on  future  generations?  That  is  the  firm  red line Pacific nations will draw in Glasgow. We are demanding net-zero emissions and accepting zero excuses.  Page  of    And,  Excellencies,  at  COP26,  the  global  north must  finally  deliver  on  $100  Billion  per  year  in climate  finance  and  agree  to  a  pathway  to increase financing commitments to at least $750 Billion  per  year  from  2025  forward.  If  we  can spend  trillions  on  missiles,  drones,  and  nuclear submarines,  we  can  fund  climate  action.  It  is criminal  that  vulnerable  Pacific  Small  Island Developing States can access a mere .% of the climate  finance  currently  available  to  protect ourselves  from  an  existential  crisis  we  did  not cause. Mr. President, these are the challenges we face, at this  UNGA  and  at  COP26.  We  must  find  the courage to face them squarely.  Page  of     The  consequences  of  not  doing  so  are  simply unthinkable. We will see you in Glasgow. Vinaka vakalevu. Thank you.  _______________ Page  of         "
111,2021,PNG,Papua New Guinea,"President of the General Assembly; His Excellency Mr. Antonio Guterres, United Nations Secretary-General; Fellow leaders, Excellencies and distinguished delegates; It is my distinguished honour and pleasure on my own behalf and that of my  million plus people and Government, to join other global leaders in addressing the General Assembly today. I  also  take  this  time  to  extend  our  condolences  to  the  families  in  your countries  who  have  lost  someone  due  to  COVID-,  and  our  get-well wishes  to  those  who  are  sick.  I  also  pay  tribute  to  the  global  frontline workers and service personnel who have toiled over and beyond the call of duty to care for those who are sick and vulnerable.  Mr President, Being my first attendance at this Global Forum, I am greatly humbled and warmly congratulate you and the Government and people of the Republic          of  the  Maldives,  on  your  mandate,  particularly  as  a  Small  Island Developing State, to lead our collective work this Session. This  is  compounded  by  the  intensifying  and  worrisome  global  climate crisis, accelerated biodiversity losses, other humanitarian, peace, security and trade related issues that pose great challenges to the way we now manage our regional and global political and socio- economic affairs. Despite  all  of  these  challenges  we  are  heartened  by  your  foresight, commitment and leadership, under your ""Presidency of Hope"" vision and theme. We unequivocally pledge to support and partner you during your tenure as President of this august forum. Mr. President, I also thank your predecessor His Excellency, Mr. Volkan Bozkir and the delegation of Turkey, for his excellent leadership and outstanding work, this past year, under very challenging circumstances. We wish him and his family well. I  want  to  place  on  record  Papua  New  Guinea's  deep  appreciation  and support  to  Secretary-General  Guterres  for  his  continuing  bold  and decisive  leadership  of  our  collective  work,  as  mandated  by  the  United Nations Charter. Mr. Secretary-General, your unanimous reappointment for another term, starting next year, is indeed a clear demonstration of the confidence and trust that UN Member States, including my own country, have in your work ethics and strong leadership, which this organisation needs at this very challenging period. I thank you for your frank and sobering assessment of the challenges before us and your proposals on how we confront these challenges, practically and at multilateral levels.   Mr. President, I bring to you all greetings from Papua New Guinea in the peaceful blue Pacific Ocean. The Pacific Ocean or the Blue Pacific Continent is home to  marine  and  terrestrial  biodiversity  and  is  where  the  most-vulnerable small island states are being exposed to global threats of rise in sea level due to climate change, and the health and the associated economic woes brought about by the COVID- pandemic. I speak for Papua New Guinea, but the issues will no doubt resonate with the small island states. I also believe, Mr President that you too will have some appreciations on what these issues are about. Our oceanic homes and our way of life is intertwined with the ecosystem in  its  natural  equilibrium.  This  equilibrium  is  now  affected  by  human influence,  not  of  our  making.  But  we  are  the  first  victims  and  the  most affected because of our inherent vulnerabilities. Mr President, As  we  convene  and  continue  to  speak  on  climate  change  in  the ambiences of our 21st century poised halls like this august UN assembly, may I remind us all that little children and their families are living in the seas of the earth in fear and uncertainty of what their future will be like. Because in their lifetime they have seen their arable and safe lands lost due to sea level rise and are watching as the structures that their lives are built upon slips away.     It is time the big carbon emitters of planet earth own up and apologise to the small island states and all other victims of climate change. And  today  I  make  a  call  to  all  of  us  and  especially  to  the  big  carbon emitting  nations,  who  are  now  enjoying their  national  economic transformations  through  industrialization,  to  pause,  think  and  take responsibility to save our planet.  I am comforted by the recent commitments by President Joe Biden and Prime  Minister  Boris  Johnson  on  their  respective  nations’  intention  to respond better to tackling climate change issues. I also hear of China’s positive responses and note that it is good that we are now uniting to save our planet. We have a collective responsibility to take actions to save earth. When astronaut Neil Armstrong walked on the moon on July , 1969, he looked back to the direction from where he’d come from and he did not see his home country – the United States of America, but he saw his home, Planet Earth. It is the survival of the Earth that we must take action on now. I want to make  this  statement.  Enough  of  talk.  We  have  to  take  actions commensurate to the volume of emissions from our industries. Leaders of the big carbon-emitting nations must now lead the global effort in  rebalancing  the  environmental  equilibrium.  It  is  a  hard  ask  but  a necessary call for leadership and champions. I point to all nation on earth to embrace the unity of humanity to save our planet,  because  what  happens  in  Africa  will  affect  Europe,  whatever happens in Asia will affect America, and whatever happens in the Middle East will affect those of us in Pacific.   We  live  in  one  planet,  one  atmospheric  envelope,  one  interlinked environmental ecosystem, hence as one humanity, we must rise and unite to preserve our one planet, our home. To not to do so is foolishness and we  are  doing  so  at  the  peril  of  our  children  and  their  Children,  if  Jesus Christ does not come back soon. Mr. President, Papua New  Guinea  recognizes the  need to save  Earth and we  too  are contributing and will contribute to preserve our Earth. God has blessed us with about  percent of the world's tropical rainforests and  percent of its biodiversity. These global assets we want to preserve.  One  lesson  I  have  learnt  from  Covid-  is  that  oxygen  is  humanity’s number  one  need;  with  less  oxygen  due  to  COVID-  then  suffocation and death. Well who produces the oxygen for earth? The trees of course! If  the  world’s  rainforest  reservoir  were  the  global  lung,  we  have  a significant proportion of this organ that keeps the world breathing. We also function as the great carbon sink. We have this significant asset for our planet. As chair of the Coalition of Rainforest Nations, Papua New Guinea stands at  an  important  crossroad.  We  are  a  net  remover  of  carbon  from  the atmosphere.  The  removal  capacity  from  our  forests  is  over  100  million tonnes  per  year. Our  energy  emissions  are  presently  around   million annually. Therefore if the REDD + Mechanism delivers as it should, PNG can  remain  where  every  country  needs  to  be  by  2050  under  the  Paris Agreement – a net remover of carbon from the atmosphere.     The preservation and conservation plus sustainable harvest and use of forest resources can be our commitment to you all for the upkeep of earth heeding the “red code for humanity” call by Secretary-General Guterres. The  recent  Inter-Governmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC)  Sixth Assessment Report is crystal clear that human actions are the cause of the  worsening  climate  crisis.  We  must  take  actions  to  change  this trajectory.  We have long said that climate change is a serious existential threat to our national security and wellbeing. Therefore, the climate-security nexus reality must and cannot continue to be denied in the Security Council, as it would be a dereliction of duty to all peoples worldwide on the part of the Council.  We  welcome  the  increasing  support  in  the  Council  on  this important agenda. Mr President, Let me also welcome and commend the excellent leadership and efforts led by the United Kingdom, as COP26 President-designate, Italy as co-host of COP26 and the UN Secretary-General, in rallying the international community to take the bold decisions and practical measures necessary to deliver on the Paris Agreement commitments. I cannot overstate the urgency and the ambitious actions needed under the Paris Agreement to undo the serious damage humanity has caused to Planet Earth. I will also continue to advocate strongly that responsibilities must be assigned correctly, appropriately, and proportionately to the scale of damages done. Mr President, During COP26, I will be seeking to progress a number of issues on behalf of Papua New Guinea and the wider Pacific Blue economy.   We  must  all  commit  to  the  energy  targets,  deal  with  land  use,  and advocate for the preservation of biodiversity and be more bold in climate financing commitments. These issues which are important to Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands Forum Countries and we will be seeking support  and  advocacy  from  developed  and  industrialised  Countries  to back our domestic and regional efforts towards adaptation and mitigation through global funding assistance. I will be seeking an understanding to build a special set of criteria that is simplified to enable us to qualify for financial support for our adaptation and mitigation strategies. Mr. President, I join the previous Speakers in calling on the international community to collectively meet our Paris Agreement obligations and submit individual Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) without delay. Papua New Guinea was among the first countries to submit our Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) in 2020 outlining our goal to be carbon neutral  by  2050.  This  plan includes the  drafting  of  our  NDCs implementation Plan, Regulations and Alignment of NDC Adaptation and National  Adaptation  Plan  thanks  to  the  support  of  the  United  Nations Development Program. We want to see major carbon emitters in the industrialised nations to be genuine and committed in their actions to fund climate change mitigation and adaptations. A failure in that regard is a denial of that responsibility.      We wish to advocate also that the US$I00 billion annual commitment by developed countries to developing nations on climate financing must be considered different from Official Development Assistance. This will allow its  guidelines  to  be  sensitive  to  the  climate  change  mitigation  and adaptation agenda and their specific requirement. As a natural gas and oil exporter Papua New Guinea is working towards ensuring  our  carbon  footprint  is  minimised  by  implementing  our Sustainable  Development  Goal    Roadmap  2020-2030  on  Climate Change launched last year. However,  despite  multiple  project  submissions  for  climate  financing, Papua  New  Guinea  has  had  limited  or  no  success  in  accessing  these funds,  except  for  technical  assistance  in  developing  the  fiduciary framework.  This  is  disappointing.  We  need  to  see  a  more  practical demonstration of genuine commitments. Other  forms  of  assistance  towards  climate  change  adaptation  and mitigation must also be streamlined to lessen the increasing debt burdens in  Small  Islands  States  to  free  up  the  required  fiscal  space  to  support economic  recovery  efforts  from  the  COVID-  pandemic  and  achieve sustainable development.  I further  call  on the  Member  States to  finalise  a  robust  and  fair Carbon Markets under the Paris Rulebook to unlock new financing streams that better account for the sustainable development interests of countries like mine.  This  will  allow  us  to  assign  our  development  agenda  under  the different but appropriate financing opportunities as long as the guidelines are appropriate but friendly.    Papua New Guinea wants to achieve both conservation and development. In forestry, we have ceased issuance of new timber permits and renewal of existing ones and will achieve complete round log export ban by 2025. We want to move into value adding and downstream processing.  We  have  adopted  and  designated  a  large  conservation  area  in  our Northern  Province  as  a  pilot  program  in  partnership  with  a  regional environmental  program  which  will  give  us  the  learning  experience  we need for further designations of conservation areas.  We are also in the process of establishing a NDC Roadmap for Agriculture Forestry and Other Land Use (AFLOU) and Energy Sector. Mr. President, COVID  will continue to remain our biggest challenge. Our numbers are low in terms of both confirmed cases and fatalities. But most concerning, the rates of vaccinations are also low. Our  Government  took  the  necessary  upfront  ownership  through  the enactment of an appropriate legislation, the National Pandemic Act 2020. This  together  with  very  close  working  partnership  with  our  valued development partners, including our Pacific family of nations through the Pacific Humanitarian Pathway on COVID- Program, has given us much success. We cannot speak highly enough of such partnerships, including those through the Covax Facility, and with the UN system, Australia, New Zealand,  US,  Japan,  China,  EU,  UK  and  United  Arab  Emirates,  which enabled us to have immediate access to essential medical equipment and supplies including the  AstraZeneca,  Johnson  and  Johnson  and Sinopharm COVID- vaccines.    We  continue  to  welcome  and  encourage  further  strengthening  of cooperative  global  efforts  to  allow  access  to  the  COVID-  vaccines  in countries where they are most needed. We advocate for global efforts in curbing misinformation that has resulted in low rates of vaccinations in our country. It will truly support our efforts in building national advocacy and awareness on the efficacy and safety of COVID  vaccines, a program ably supported by our development partners, including most notably the churches and the UN country office. We have to do all of that while keeping a close eye on the general health sector business as usual. A National Health Plan is ready to be launched except for the settlement of the financing plan. It will encompass facilities development, capacity building, pharmaceutical procurement, development of primary, secondary and tertiary health care, and provincial capacities, and the requisite capacity building and education. Mr. President, Economic  management  for  us  involves  taking  stock  of  where  we  were, building the structures for reengagement with our international partners, and ensuring that the right enablers are put in place to build and sustain a robust economy. It involves taking  stock  of  our  debt  portfolios,  reprioritising  our expenditures,  and  focusing  on  important  reforms  in  the  utilities  sector, infrastructure, education, health and the natural resources. It also involved taking a closer look at specific projects in the extractive industry and working with their proponents to see them come on stream. For the two years, the bulk of our effort was to ensure that we achieve a fine balance between adherence to all COVID  requirements, while at the same time ensure that the economy is open and functioning.   Our work in the transparent stock take of our debt portfolios have resulted in  attracting  strong  support from the World Bank  and the  IMF,  and  has provided  very  important  platform  of  support  from  Australia,  Japan  and other bilateral partners. We acknowledge their support to us at this time. We  continue  to  advocate  for  the  use  of  our  natural  resources.  But  the foundational tenet is that the development of these resources are to be done on the premise that all stakeholders have a shared interests in these developments, and these interests are to be fully satisfied within principles of ‘equity and equality’ where we live no one behind. A  key  area  of  focus  is  the  substantive  investment  and  development  of quality  economic  infrastructure  to  link  the  provinces  throughout  the country  and  deliver  important  services  to  our  citizens  countrywide  and enhance their socio-economic opportunities. We  have  embarked  on  an  important  connectivity  program  branded Connect PNG, which is building and expanding infrastructure assets such as national roads, wharves, jetties, airports, airstrips, punching new road corridors,  information  and  telecommunication  network  and  electricity access to the majority of our population. This  is  the  stimulus  for  economic  transformation  for  our  people.  This  is done as required by our National Constitution and in alignment with The Eight  Point  Plan,  PNG  Vision  2050,  Development  Strategic  Plan  2010-2030,  Medium-Term  Plan  III  2018-2022  and  the  2030  Agenda  for Sustainable  Development  (SDGs)  to  better  deliver  socio-economic prosperity for the country and become a Middle-Income Country by 2050.     Mr. President, Growth for PNG continues to be off the back of the petroleum, energy and mining sectors, which contribute around  percent of our Gross Domestic Product (GDP). We continue to advocate for these developments to take place,  and  do  as  much  as  we  can,  as  hard  as  we  can  to  advocate  for important policies in those sectors. Our  policies  on  developments  in  the  extractive  sector  has  begun  to  be cognizant of the diminishing financing envelop from external sources such as  loans  and  grants.  At  the  same  time,  we  have  had  to  move  towards better management of our national public debt. We strongly recognize the importance  of  generating  sufficient  revenue  from  domestic  sources,  to complement  external  budget  support,  for  our  national  development priorities, as called for under the General Assembly's 2030 Agenda and the Addis Ababa Financing for Development Framework. It  is  in  this  spirit  that  my  government  has  embarked  on  reviewing  and reforming  our  legislation  and  policies  in  the  resources  sector  to  ensure appropriate levels of national content in projects and to facilitate fair and equitable returns for all stakeholders with shared interests. At the same time, we continue to value, respect and uphold our partnership obligations with the private sector in our natural resources sector. We remain open for  business and  therefore welcome  bona fide  international  investors to join us in exploring opportunities available in my country.       Mr. President, My country continues to enjoy the partnership with important multilateral financial institutions. Let me take a moment to thank the World Bank, IMF, ADB and our valued bilateral partners, including Australia, New Zealand, Japan, China, India, European Union and the United States for supporting my Government’s development priorities. It  would  be  remiss  of  me  not  to  also  acknowledge  the  excellent  work undertaken under the  leadership of the  Prime Ministers of Canada  and Jamaica  and  the  UN  Secretary-General  for  financing  for  development needed particularly in developing countries to recover and build back from the COVID- pandemic. A call, Papua New Guinea strongly supports. Mr. President, My government has prioritised investment in the agriculture sector as an engine of economic growth and prosperity for the country. The strategic interventions  are  a  combination  of  credit  scheme,  freight  and  price subsidies which has helped broaden the scope and reach of agricultural production.  This  will  not  only  help  broaden  the  tax  base  and  generate additional  revenue  the  country  needs  for  development  but  also  more importantly  improve  our  rural  communities’  lives  and  livelihoods  and enable them to be proactive nation builders. Our largely rural-based economy is dependent on subsistence agriculture. It  is  my  government’s  desire  to  transform  the  agriculture  sector  into  a reliable,  commercial,  sustainable  food  system  that  will  address  food security and climate resilience as well as conservation and management of our vast biodiversity.   To support this, we have set targets to increase cash crop production by  percent and also increase livestock production by  percent by 2025 and develop taxation incentives for our local farmers. Additionally, these include the formulation of an Agriculture and Livestock Diversification  Plan  by  2025  and  our  efforts  to  increase  down-stream processing  by    percent  in  2025  and  ensure  local  landowners  and Provincial  Governments  participate  in  equity  sharing  and  downstream business spin-offs. Mr. President, Our efforts in the agriculture sector ties in well with the important global efforts under the UN Food Systems Summit, convened virtually yesterday by the UN Secretary-General. For Papua New Guinea, we have identified five Key Priority Actions that forms our National Pathway to transform our Food Systems in ways that will build a sustainable, equitable, resilient, and healthier food system in our country. These details were shared in our national statement at the Food Systems Summit yesterday evening. However, I would underline that my country with its arable and abundant land has the potential to serve as a food basket for the Asia-Pacific region and beyond, particularly at a time when food security around the world is now been threatened by the ravages of climate change, sea-level rise and other crisis.  We  therefore  welcome  multi-stakeholder  partnership  and  investment  to transform  our  organic  food  systems  to  support  address  the  global challenges  relating  to  hunger,  poverty,  malnutrition,  food  security  that fosters better health outcomes for our peoples and communities and to deliver on the SDGs.   Mr. President, In the energy sector, we recognise the importance of energy transition to renewable  sources  to  move  significantly  away  from  fossil  fuels  and  to options including hydro, solar, wind and geothermal energy. We also have options with clean gas energy. Our  government  has  since  2018  under  auspices  of  the  Asia  Pacific Economic  Cooperation  (APEC),  been  working  with  our  development partners (Australia, Japan, New Zealand and the US), on the Papua New Guinea Electrification Program (PEP). This is intended to provide reliable and  affordable  renewable  energy  to  the  unreached    percent  of households  in  the  country  by  2030.  Enormous  development  outcomes ride on this program for our people. We have struck partnership with the International Solar Alliance and the International  Renewable  Energy  Agency  (IRENA)  and  Fortescue  Metal Group to strengthen our renewable energy transformation and options in geothermal and hydro power energy. Our  energy  transformation  will  come  about  when  the  National  Energy Authority  is  fully  established.  It  is  a  strategic  act  early  this  year  of extracting regulatory responsibilities and placing it where it can do the best in  terms  of  facilitating  important  investment  and  development  into  the different energy options as well as recapitalising current energy provider to  bring  it  to  a  place  where  it  can  respond  to  our  energy  requirements better.      Mr. President, The virtual first-ever High-Level Dialogue on Energy convened today by the  Secretary-General  to  accelerate  efforts  in  implementing  SDG7  on energy-related  goals  and  targets  for  sustainable  development  is  most timely and needed. It resonates well with my Government's development priorities  and  we  look  forward  to  harnessing  the  Ten-year  Action  Plan under the Global Roadmap to attain SDG7 by 2030 and further explore joining an ""Energy Compact"" to support SDG7 achievement by 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by 2050. Mr. President,  As  a  maritime  nation  with  a  maritime  zone  spanning  over  .  million square  kilometres  the  oceans  agenda  is  of  immense  importance  to  my country, not only for the living and non-living resources for the added value they  bring to  our  national  assets  but also more importantly  for  our  own identity and way of life as a people and nation.  My  government  is  also  prioritising  and  strengthening  the  management, governance  and  security  of  our  maritime  zones  under  our  National Oceans Policy 2020 — 2030, which was adopted in July 2020.  To further complement this, my Government also officially launched last month  our ten-year  National Fisheries  Strategic Plan  2021-2030,  which provides the roadmap and vision for a broad-based fisheries sector and industry that is, inclusive,  environmentally  sustainable,  globally competitive and promotes food security.     Furthermore, it  addresses issues including  prevention  of Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in our country and neighbouring Pacific  waters  and  domestic  downstream  processing  that  enables  our people,  as  resource  owners  to  be  meaningfully  involved  in  economic opportunities. We call on countries within our region to be responsible in that regard. Mr President,  I  am  pleased  to  say  that  my  Government  adopted  and  launched  the country's Marine Protected Areas Policy and the National Action Plan of Action  for  Stingrays,  Skates  and  Sharks  in  June  2021.  This  Policy  will strengthen  our  efforts  to  better  protect  our  marine  resources,  as  an epicentre of global marine resources and biodiversity. We are grateful for the  support  from  the  Global  Environment  Facility  (GEF)  and  UNDP,  as valued development partners. In doing so, this will assist us to reach the Biodiversity Aichi Target  to have  percent of terrestrial and inland water areas and  percent of coastal and marine areas protected, which we remain committed to. It is in  this  context  and  also  with  the  devastating  wildfires  and  catastrophic climate  change  events  around  the  world  impacting  adversely  on biodiversity  that  we  look  forward  to  a  successful  outcome  of  the  15th Conference of Parties of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (COP ) in China next month.  We  therefore  join  the  growing  global  call  for  an  ambitious  and transformational Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework that can help us fully implement our national commitments to protect biodiversity and sustainably using them for our sustainable development and also meeting the SDGs.   Mr. President,  Regionally, I am pleased to join my fellow leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum in heralding our milestone regional Declaration on preserving our maritime zones in the face of climate change-related sea-level rise, which was adopted last month. As  large  oceanic  States  within  a  Blue  Pacific  Continent  and  with  the advent of the devastating consequences of runaway climate change and rising  sea-levels  that  continue  to  threaten  our  countries  and  people’s security  and  lives  and  livelihoods,  and  sovereignty,  this  Declaration preserves our maritime zones in the face of climate change-related sea-level rise. It also upholds the integrity of; and our long-standing commitment to; the UN  Convention  on  the  Law  of  the  Sea  (UNCLOS)  as  the  global  legal framework  within  which  all  activities  in  the  oceans  and  seas  must  be carried out. We therefore welcome the support of all UN Member States and the international community to our landmark Declaration. My earlier remark on climate change gives us the basis to call for those support and actions. Mr. President, In terms  of  peacebuilding,  my  Government  recognizes the  fundamental role  the  UN  plays  in  supporting  sustainable  development  and  peace building.       It is therefore incumbent on the United Nations to ensure that we continue to  adapt  the  existing  multilateral  arrangements,  including  the  UN Peacebuilding  Architecture,  the  Security  Council,  the  Peacebuilding Commission  (PBC),  the  Secretary-General's  Action  for  Peace  (A4P) Initiative and the Peacebuilding Fund (PBF), to make them relevant under evolving global circumstances to better foster and sustain global, regional and national peace and security. For us, our continuing engagement with the Peacebuilding Commission and  the  Secretary-General's  Peacebuilding  Fund,  in  recent  years,  and from which we have been a beneficiary, further strengthens the hand of national peace and security through peace by peaceful means. This is especially true on our Bougainville Peace Agreement process for our  Bougainville  region  and  in  the  new  initiative  on  peacebuilding  and sustaining peace in two other provinces in the country. Mr. President, The  Bougainville  peace  process continues  to  remain  the top  priority for my Government. In  this  context,  I  would  like  to  inform  this  august  Hall  that  following  the referendum in 2019, my Government and the Autonomous Bougainville Government  have  held  the  Second  Post-Referendum  Consultation  and the Joint Supervisory Board (JSB) just three months ago, where several important decisions to move the peace process forward were agreed.      These  included  the  reaffirmation  of  both  Parties  commitment  to  the Bougainville Peace Agreement; the importance of peaceful dialogue on the way forward, guided by the country's constitutional and parliamentary processes, including with respect to the outcome of the 2019 referendum; the transfer of agreed powers; and a Joint Roadmap to guide the post-referendum processes. Mr President, There is a clear recognition by both parties that much more work remains to  be  done  in  this  critical  phase  and  that  constructive  dialogue,  mutual understanding and partnership is crucial for a lasting political settlement of the Autonomous Region of Bougainville. My  government  is  also  realistic  about  our  capacity  challenges  to successful peacebuilding and sustaining peace. The continued supportive partnership  of  the  Peacebuilding  Commission,  the  Secretary-General's Peacebuilding  Fund  and  the  wider  United  Nations  system  and  other development  partners  will  be  vital  to  ensure  the  dividends  of  peace  is shared and becomes long lasting. I acknowledge the strong support by the UN in chairing the consultation process, and supporting the initial engagement of a moderator for these talks.        I would also like to put on record our sincere appreciation to our valued bilateral  and  multilateral  development  partners,  including  Australia, European  Union,  Japan,  China,  Germany,  Ireland,  New  Zealand,  the United States, United Kingdom and the United Nations system, for their continuing  commitment  and  support  towards  the  Bougainville  peace process  and  the  recent  initiative  in  two  provinces  in  the  country's Highlands region  and  look  forward  to further work with  all  development partners on this important priority for my Government. Whilst commending the UN on the peace efforts in Papua New Guinea, I would  also  like  to  recall  the  Pacific  Islands  Forum  Leaders  decision  in 2019  and the  outstanding visit  by  the UN Human Rights mechanism to address the alleged  human  rights concerns  in  our neighbourhood. This visit  is  important  to  ensure  that  the  greater  peoples  of  the  region  have peace  within  their  respective  sovereignties  and  their  rights  and  cultural dignities are fully maintained.  Mr. President, We also have long recognised that our sustainable development efforts will be in vain if we do not safeguard our women and girl’s human rights and  dignity  and  provide  them  opportunities  to  be  equal  development partners for nation building. This  is  why  my  Government  has  prioritised  gender  equality  and empowerment  opportunities,  policies,  laws,  strategies  and  set  in  place among others the Gender-Based Violence Strategy (2016 — 2025) and the Family Protection Act and provided this demographic segment of our economy  specific  economic  opportunities to  be  engaged in entrepreneurial activities to empower them.   These  initiatives  take  account  of  our  international  commitments  and obligations  under  relevant  international  frameworks,  notably  the  Beijing Platform  for  Action.  We  recognize  that  much  more  work  remains  to  be done  but  we  are  determined  and  committed  to  do  what  is  right  for  our women  and  girls  as  our  country's  future  prosperity  and  security  also depends on how we treat them. This  is  clearly  demonstrated  recently  by  the  groundswell  of  support  to combat and end the scourge of gender-based violence in the country. I am pleased to note that this year my Government with the support of the Parliamentarians  to  End  Gender-Based  Violence  (GBV)  established  a bipartisan Special Parliamentary Committee on Gender Based Violence to  inquire  into  gender-based  violence  in  the  country  and  proposed recommendations and measures to combat and end this scourge. A Report of this important work has been tabled in Parliament and we are working towards implementing it.  This will complement the work done under the EU-Ied and UN supported Spotlight  Initiative  for  Ending  Violence  Against  Women  and  Children, which  was  jointly  launched  with  UN  Deputy  Secretary-General  Amina Mohammed in March 2020 in Port Moresby. And I thank Her Excellencies for the visit not only to our capital city Port Moresby but rural PNG. We  are  also  embarking  on  administrative  measures  for  quotas  for women's representation in Parliament. The inadequate representation of women Parliamentarians is a continuing concern for us. We are optimistic to set in motion this is initiative at our next general election scheduled for July 2022.   These are but some of the key issues my Government is now working on in  our  Third  cycle  Universal  Periodic  Review  (UPR)  Report  to  be presented to the Human Rights Council in November 2021. Mr. President, Before  I  conclude,  I  would  like  to  reiterate  our  call  on  the  General Assembly  to  do  better  in  delivering  on  the  reforms  of  the  UN  Security Council.  This important  organ,  entrusted  with the international community's  peace  and  security,  with  its  archaic  representation  and working methods is in dire need of an overhaul to ensure it meets with today's reality. We are concerned that it has been nearly  long years now since the first round of the Inter-Governmental Negotiations (IGN) for the reforms of the Security Council and the costs keep on escalating for countries like ours. Despite all the extensive efforts on the five agreed elements of the IGN package it still does not have any formal status. For  my  delegation,  a  single  consolidated  document,  now,  not  in  an indeterminate future is needed for real negotiations to pave the way for the  reforms  of  the  Security  Council.  The  importance  of  this  cannot  be overstated and we reiterate our call on this fundamental point. I  also  recognise,  as  I  close,  the  important  reality  check  by  Secretary General  Gutteres  in  his  call  for  action  on  the  Common  Agenda.  The Secretary  General’s  proposals  and  recommendations  calls  for  a  robust UN  system.  We  cannot  progress  the  Common  Agenda  without  dealing with the system that will carry it.    I  thank  you,  Mr.  President  for  the  opportunity  to  speak.  Under  your Presidency,  we  hope  for  a  better  planet  for  all  where  we  leave  no  one person or no place behind. God bless you all; God bless our planet earth.  "
112,2021,SLB,Solomon Islands,"President, Excellencies, Distinguished delegates, On behalf of the Government and people of Solomon Islands, let me take this opportunity to congratulate your Excellency Mr.  Abdulla Shahid and the government and people of Maldives on your election as  President  of  the  76th  Session  of the  United  Nations  General Assembly. I am confident that through your able leadership, you will proficiently lead us through our agenda and serve this organization well.  I  assure  you  as  a  fellow Small Islands  Developing State,  of Solomon  Islands’ support  and  cooperation  during your  tenure  in office.  On this note, I must also commend your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Volkan Bozkir, for his sterling leadership of the General Assembly over the past session. I highly commend his efforts in ensuring the work of the assembly progressed despite the challenges faced by the United Nations Secretariat and member states’ missions. I wish him every success in his future endeavors.  Let me also use this occasion to extend my congratulations on behalf of the government and people of Solomon Islands to His Excellency Mr. Antonio Guterres on his re-appointment as the United Nations Secretary  General.  The  United  Nations  is  confronted with  many    challenges including the  COVID- pandemic, climate change and sea level rise and peace and security to name a few.  Tackling  these  global  challenges  effectively  calls  for  a  strong multilateral  system  of  genuine  and  durable  partnerships  and cooperation between countries.  Allow  me  to  assure  you  Secretary  General  Guterres  of  Solomon Islands support and cooperation as you endeavor to lead this august body to address the important issues and challenges that confront our nations and which we must all work together to address.  Mr. President,  The theme for the 76th Session of the UNGA - ""Building resilience through hope - to recover from COVID-, rebuild sustainability, respond to the needs of the planet, respect the rights of people, and  revitalize  the  United  Nations”  aptly  summarizes  the challenges facing our world today and the collective hope that we all share to overcome these challenges. At  the  outset,  I  offer  my  sincerest  condolences on  behalf  of  the government and people of Solomon Islands to all who have lost loved ones to the coronavirus. We stand in solidarity with you all in the face of adversity during these unprecedented times. Eighteen months after the global COVID- pandemic was declared, the  battle  against  this  contagious disease  has  never  been  more important, complex, and challenging. More than 216 million people   worldwide have been infected by this virus. More than .  million people sadly died from the virus.  While  science has  given  us  a  breathing  space  through  vaccines, several contagious and more lethal variants of the disease including the  delta  variant  are  causing  new  waves  of  infection  in  many countries around the world.  Concerted collective action by  all UN  members using all forms  of partnerships bilaterally and multilaterally is needed now, more than ever, to help us to collectively address the challenges all our countries are facing today.  Mr. President,  Solomon Islands has so far successfully controlled the spread of the virus. To date, we have recorded  imported COVID19 cases on our shores. We have managed to eliminate the infections in our border quarantine facilities. I am pleased to announce we have not had an active case of COVID - for the last five months.  My government is delivering on its two overarching policy objectives during  these  trying  times  which  are  (i)  to  protect  all  Solomon Islanders  and  other  nationals  living  in  the  country  against  the COIVD- virus, and (ii) to drive and keep the  country’s economy afloat. We are achieving these two objectives.     Mr. President, The COVID- pandemic has highlighted gaps in our health system and overall response capacities. My government is addressing this and  has  put  in  place  measures  to  secure  our  borders.  We  have expanded  our  COVID-  testing  capability.  The  pandemic  has enabled us  to improve our health system and  healthcare facilities throughout the country.  On  this note, I  express  my  government’s sincere gratitude  to  our development partners that have assisted us in our response to the CVID- pandemic. I thank all donors and partners to the COVAX Facility. I thank the governments of Australia, Indonesia, Japan, New Zealand, and the People’s Republic of China. I also thank the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank, the United Nations agencies and in  particular,  United Nations  International Children’s Emergency Fund  and  the  World  Health  Organization,  and  our  regional institutions for  their  kind  assistance  and  support.  Your  support ranging  from  direct  financial  contribution  to  the  provision  of vaccines, equipment, medical and other operational equipment, and supplies has enabled my government to protect our people thus far from COVID-. Your unwavering support is deeply appreciated and will continue to be needed as we go forward.  Vaccination is our best defense against the virus. We associate with the  voice  of  reason  that  ‘no  one  is  safe  until  everyone  is  safe’. Cooperation in combating COVID- must be based on the unity and solidarity. The  world  must  act  together  to  combat COVID-.  We   cannot afford to be divided in our approaches. We look forward to working with all our partners going forward.  Our  vaccination rollout  program  is  moving  in  the  right  direction although not as fast as we want it  to be. We have set ourselves a target  of  at  least  %  fully  vaccinated  coverage  of  our  eligible population before we consider re-opening our borders. Mr. President, Providing accurate information regularly about the disease and the progress in combating it has enabled our public to be better prepared and participate in our fight against COVID-. We keep our public informed through talk back shows and my regular public address to the nation which is broadcasted live on air and televised. In the long term, the Government is in the process of finalizing its Public  Health  Bill  that  will  provide  a  legislative  framework  to effectively respond to any Health crisis that may face the country in future.  On that note, I  commend and thank our  very hardworking healthcare workers and all our frontline agencies who had worked tirelessly  to  protect  our  nation against  this  deadly  disease. Your sacrifice and dedication are greatly appreciated. Mr. President, The negative impacts of the COVID- pandemic on our economy had been significant. By mid-2021 our balance of trade deficit was around $ million; $ million higher than the previous month. This is a substantial amount for our small economy. This negative outcome   stemmed from  a  larger  fall in exports by  % against a  marginal decline in imports by %. Restrictions on international travel into the country has also impacted heavily on the tourism industry forcing tourism operators to drastically scale down their operations.  To keep the economy afloat  my  government introduced immediate recovery measures. We implemented ‘economic stimulus packages’ to  drive  the  productive  sectors.  We  launched  our  ‘Umi  Tugeda tourism”  initiative.  We  drove  several  transformational and  ‘game changing’  national  projects  to  boost  the  economy  and  provide employment opportunities for our people as we try to stabilize our economy. The Pacific Labour Scheme Solomon Islands has with Australia, New Zealand and Canada has provided needed employment for many of our youths. We have reached new heights in our partnership with Australia  in  labour  mobility  for  which  we  are  thankful.  These partnerships put  human faces  to  our relationships with Australia, New Zealand, Canada in the labour mobility front. They contribute to our economic recovery efforts.  Mr. President,  As a Small Islands Developing State, Solomon Islands continues to battle with the incremental effects of climate change and its negative impacts that threaten the livelihoods, security, and wellbeing of our people. The Pacific Island countries and territories have  identified    Climate Change as the ‘single greatest threat’ to our people and to the planet. It is a global issue that needs a global solution.  We  remain  deeply  concerned  that  we  are  falling  behind  in  our commitments  under  the  Paris  Agreement.  Already  global  the temperature has increased above pre-industrial level to . Celsius degrees. The most recent Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change  delivered  the  starkest  warning  yet  about  the deepening climate emergency.  The IPCC Report further stated that limiting global warming to close to . degrees Celsius or even  degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels  “will  be  beyond  reach”  in  the  next  two  decades,  without immediate,  rapid,  and  large-scale  reductions  in  greenhouse  gas emissions.  We  strongly call on all major greenhouse gas emitting countries to cut emissions and take more ambitious action place the world on a ‘below . degrees Celsius pathway’.  Sadly, the current trend is driving humanity towards a ‘three degrees Celsius  world’  which  we  can  all  agree  is  not  world  we  wish  to bequeath to our future generations. COP26 in Glasgow  to be  held in  November this year,  presents an opportunity for the world to operationalize the Paris Agreement, and conclude negotiations on the Paris Rulebook.   Establishment of,  common time  frame  for  Nationally Determined Contributions is needed. Markets and non-market negotiations need   to  be  concluded  and  Loss  and  Damage  solutions  to  be operationalized.  Further  support  is  needed  for  the  Warsaw  Mechanism  and  an Adaptation Fund should serve and support the Paris Agreement.  The time for action is now. Mr. President,  Solomon Islands is a large ocean state. Its’ total Exclusive Economic Zone  covers  an  area  of  just  over  .  million  square  kilometers. Together with   other  countries and  territories our  total  EEZ  is almost  million square kilometers of Ocean.  The Solomon Islands tuna industry generates around $ million in revenue  on  an  annual basis  and  provides employment for  ,000 Solomon Islanders.  Our people have a multidimensional relationship with the ocean. We recognize the climate–ocean nexus and call on the  global community take  stronger climate action  to  protect  our oceans.  The  devastating impact  of  plastic pollution on  our  fragile  marine ecosystems demands a global binding agreement to reduce plastic pollution in our oceans. We support the establishment of such an Agreement.  As  an ocean locked state,  Solomon  Islands remains committed to negotiating a  legally  binding instrument on  the  conservation and sustainable  use  of  marine  biological  diversity  of  areas  beyond national jurisdiction under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.    My  government  looks  forward  to  an  Agreement  that  is  fair, comprehensive  and  one that  provides capacity  building for  small island developing states such as Solomon Islands to fully implement. We must strive to complete these negotiations as soon as possible.   Protecting  the  sovereignty  of  Solomon  Islands’  maritime  zones remains important priority of my government. We continue to work towards the completion of the delimitation of all our maritime zones in accordance with the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.  In  this regard,  my  government supports the  ongoing work that  is being  undertaken  by  the  International  Law  Commission  on  the question of  sea  level rise  and  sovereignty. It  is  my  government’s unwavering position that once national maritime zones are deposited with the  United Nations, they  should never be  challenged. Rights must  be  respected  irrespective  of  sea  level  rise.  This  proposal preserves  the  principles  of  equity,  fairness  and  justice  of  the Convention  and  recognizes  UNCLOS  principles  of  legal  stability, security, certainty, and predictability.  Twelve years ago, Solomon Islands submitted four continental shelf claims with the UN Commission on the Limits on Continental Shelf. Once considered these claims will further expand Solomon Islands sovereignty. We  look  forward  to  working with  the  Commission to finalize consideration on the stated claims.  Mr. President,    Solomon Islands is a party to the 1985 the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty, we therefore would like to keep our region nuclear free and put the region’s nuclear legacy  behind us. The ocean remains the life blood for our survival and would like to work with everyone in keeping it blue and healthy.  The United Nations was established out of the ashes of World War II. As  a  peace-loving state,  Solomon Islands will do its  part  to  build bridges of cooperation and highways of friendship and partnership in our region and beyond. Solomon Islands is committed ensuring the Pacific region remains a peaceful region where its people can live free and worthwhile lives. We do not support any form of militarization in our region that could threaten regional and international peace and stability.   Mr. President,  Solomon Islands is in  its transition phase of  graduating from the Least Developing Countries category and is scheduled to graduate by 2024.  In  preparing for  our  graduation,  we  have so  far  concluded several  regional and bilateral trade  agreements within the Pacific, with the European and the United Kingdom of Great Britain. We have a non-reciprocal trade arrangement with China.  However, with the impact of COVID-, an in-depth analysis on the health of the Solomon Islands economy will need to be done. We hope to complete this before the next the triennial review. It is the view of    my government that the date of graduation should be delayed due to the challenges posed by the COVID- pandemic the least developing countries.  I take this opportunity to call on our development partners to  also align their support and priority programs with the Solomon Islands National Development Strategy to assist Solomon Islands achieve our development objectives. Mr. President, On UN reform, Solomon Islands aligns with call from countries for a reform in one of the principal organs of the UN that is responsible for the  maintenance  of  international  peace  and  security  –  the  UN Security Council.   The UN Security Council will need to adapt to today’s realities and support an expanded Council with a SIDS-dedicated seat. It has been sixteen  years  since  world  leaders  called  for  early  reform  of  the Council,  we  hope  negotiations  could  shift into  text-based negotiations at this session.  Mr. President,  Solomon Islands recognizes the importance of Human  Rights and subscribe  to  the  principles  of  UN  Charter  and  believes  genuine partnership can further promote and protect the rights of all.  Solomon Islands supports the role of the Human Rights Council and the  Universal Periodic Review mechanisms as  a  platform  through   which countries can  engage in mutual dialogue on human rights concerns.  Furthermore, I  am  pleased to inform this Assembly that Solomon Islands has presented its  National Report for the third cycle of the Universal  Periodic  Review.  Through  this  report  Solomon  Islands reiterated  its  commitment  to  strengthening  its  human  rights mechanisms including through the establishment of national human rights  reporting  mechanism  that  would  allow  for  the  timely submission of human rights reports.  Solomon Islands  is  also  committed to  ratifying  UNCRC  Optional Protocol  on  the  sale  of  children,  child  prostitution,  child pornography, and several other Human Rights Conventions.  On  the  domestic front,  Solomon Islands  continues to  review  our national frameworks that will further promote and protect the human rights of all Solomon Islanders, in particular, the  most vulnerable such as our women, children, and people with disabilities.  Mr. President,  I  also wish to offer my deep thanks to Cuba for the training of our medical students. More than ninety Solomon Islands medical doctors have graduated from Cuban medical schools. We note with concern the  -year-old economic embargo  imposed on  Cuba  remains in place and we reiterate the call for the lifting of the embargo within the spirit and purposes of the United Nations Charter.  Mr. President,   Decolonisation remains an ongoing issue Solomon Islands follows at the UN. In this regard we note the ongoing UN referendum process taking place in New Caledonia. The first referendum occurred in 2018 and then again in 2020. The third referendum is scheduled for 2022 and  we  once again urge  that  the  process conforms to  universally accepted principles and practices of  self-determination defined by resolution 1514 (XV), 1541 (XV) and other relevant resolutions of the United Nations.  Finally, Mr. President,  Allow me to conclude by commending you again on the theme for this year’s General Assembly session. It could not have come at a more critical time when we find ourselves facing the deadliest pandemic that has affected our world under our watch.  The  COVID-  pandemic will shape our  legacy  as  leaders of  our countries and our  world. Our  responses to  the  pandemic  will be remembered for ever by those who had lost loved ones, by those that believed we  could  have  done  more  but  didn’t,  by  those  that  felt betrayed by their leaders, and by those that were appreciative of the collective efforts all countries of this world had undertaken to fight an invisible enemy that is only visible in the suffering and agony of those affected and those left behind. More than . million lives have been tragically lost, and  millions continue to be affected by its ongoing onslaught. Let us take time to pause and to reflect, on how this virus has changed our lives and the   way we do business as we look at ways, we can collaborate better to alleviate its impacts.  As  we continue to  confront the problems and challenges that  our world faces ranging from climate change to the deteriorating health of our planet and the COVID- pandemic; we must remember, there is more that binds us together as a human race than divides us. We must dig deep and reach out to each other with a hand of friendship, and  we  must  embrace  multilateralism  as  an  important  tool  to confront global challenges. Mr  President,  Fellow  leaders  of  our  world,  I  thank  you  for  your attention.    "
113,2021,VUT,Vanuatu,"President; Excellencies, Heads of State and Governments; Mr. Secretary-General; Distinguished Delegates; Ladies and Gentlemen, Introduction I have the great honour to deliver this address on behalf of the government and people of the Republic of Vanuatu. Mr President,  At the outset, let  me sincerely congratulate  you on assuming the presidency of this 76th session  of  the  United  Nations  General  Assembly.  Your  Excellency,  I  assure  you  of Vanuatu’s  committed  support  during  your  tenure.  We  have  every  confidence  that  your presidency will successfully guide us in our collective pursuit of the future we want, and rally the spirit of cooperation essential for the United Nations we need.          I would also like to extend our heartfelt gratitude to His Excellency Volkan Bozkir, the outgoing President of the 75th Session on his outstanding stewardship of this august body during such a challenging time. Mr. President, Let me join my fellow world leaders by expressing Vanuatu’s sympathy and solidarity to all Governments and peoples around the world who have been gravely impacted by the COVID- pandemic. The  UN  High  -Level  Week  is  convened  at  a  time  where  we  need  to  scale  up  our collaborative efforts to find solutions to a myriad of global issues, not least to join efforts in containing the COVID- pandemic.  Disease and despair have characterized the past two years.  Inequality, injustice and instability have increased.  Our planet is suffering and we need to get moving again, rebuild communities and join efforts to rescue the planet, recover economies and restore hope.  We need to adapt to the new normal to work together towards a better future for ourselves, our children and the future generations to come.   The theme for this 76th Session “we need to rebuild sustainably.  Our decade of action will now also have to be a decade of recovery, focused on building back better, stronger, greener and  bluer”  is  very  fitting  to  address  the  current  global  challenges  that  we  face  and  is consistent with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Global Challenges Mr. President,         The last two years have been undoubtedly dominated by the COVID- pandemic which has thus far resulted in the death of more than  million people worldwide.  The pandemic represents one of the most profound challenges to socio-economic development in all countries.   There is no doubt that it has a broad humanitarian, social and economic impact in the short to long term and has set back achievements of the 2030 agenda and sustainable development goals.   There  are  increasingly  evident  effects  of  climate  change,  including  record-breaking wildfires, flooding and more extreme temperatures.  The latest IPCC report provides new estimates of the chances of crossing the global warming level of . degrees in the next decades. Unless there are immediate, rapid and large-scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, limiting warming to near . degrees will be beyond reach.   These  issues  are  increasingly  eluding  the  control  of  individual  national  governments. Global solidarity and concerted international cooperation is therefore very essential.  For us and other small island developing states especially, our biggest threats are global – most notably  climate  change,  the  management  of  our  oceans  and  of  course  the  COVID- pandemic.  Therefore, our solutions too must be global. To  recover  better  together, we need to take comprehensive action at the global, regional and national levels.  Effective and  sustainable  support  is  now  needed  more  than  ever  to  regain  momentum  of international  cooperation  to  advancing  the  2030  Agenda,  while  building  inclusive economies and resilient societies. The  Pacific  leaders  during  the  recent  51st  Pacific  Islands  Forum  meeting  also acknowledged  the  challenges  that  threatens  the  strength  and  solidarity  of  the  Forum family and called on leaders to be redirected to the Pacific Way of dialogue to address these  challenges.  This  includes  the  COVID-  pandemic,  economic  challenges,  the      intensifying  climate  crisis  facing  Pacific  Island  Countries  and  intensification  of  geo-political competition in the Pacific region. Vanuatu situation Mr President, In  all  countries,  the  economic  shock  caused  by  the  pandemic  has  exposed  structural weaknesses,  notably  in  health  and  social  protection  systems.    For  Vanuatu,  a  recently graduated  least  developed  country  (LDC),  the  challenge  was  compounded  by  a  natural disaster.  The COVID- pandemic followed by the Category  Tropical Cyclone Harold which caused extensive devastation in April 2020 has meant detrimental impacts on the economy, society and communities at an unprecedented level.  The path to recovery will be a challenging one to navigate if the pandemic is not contained soon.   Like  many  other  small  Pacific  island  countries,  Vanuatu  has  managed  to  escape  the COVID- transmission. Swift lockdown on international borders provided a window to prepare on the health side, but these containment measures have crippled the economy.  If the Coronavirus did enter Vanuatu, the health focus would immediately need to swing from prevention and preparedness to treatment and containment.  An internal lockdown would heavily impact private and domestic sector participation in recovery process, add further stress to the economy and deepen the impact on community coping mechanisms. For  Vanuatu,  rapid  closure  of  international  borders  in  March  2020,  meant  transitioning from a health threat to an economic emergency. Many businesses, especially those reliant on  tourism  effectively  ground  to  a  halt.  No  tourist  arrivals  and  a  reduced  resident community immediately impacted the hospitality and construction sectors, putting at least ,000 formal jobs in jeopardy and affecting the livelihoods of tens of thousands of people        in  the  informal  sector.  For  more  than  ,000  licensed  handicraft  artisans,  their  incomes plummeted to near-zero.  Mr. President, As a small island nation, we know too well the importance of global solidarity. We know from experience that we are always better off when we are working together rather than in isolation.  It was in this spirit that we came together as a nation in July to celebrate our 41st anniversary of  political  independence.    We  celebrated  our  achievements  with  strong  determination, resilience and hope for a better future despite the catastrophe that has been unleashed by the pandemic and natural disasters.  We recommitted ourselves as a nation to work towards economic self-reliance with a major focus on the productive sector. In  responding  to  the  COVID-  and  TC  Harold,  the  Vanuatu  Government  has  put together policies and strategies, aligned to the National Sustainable Development Plan, to address the impacts of the compounded disaster. We reacted swiftly, imposing international lockdown followed by an extended period of national state of emergency from March 2020 to date as an immediate measure to contain the spread of the virus. We  developed  a  national  recovery  strategy  that  is  aimed  at  supporting  communities impacted by TC Harold and COVID-, providing that framework to recover, rebuild and emerge stronger and more resilient.  The strategy responds to social, economic and environmental impacts of the compounded disaster.  It re-establishes and strengthens the public service to effectively lead and implement recovery in health and education,         support and protect people with disabilities and other vulnerable groups, in repairing and upgrading infrastructure and strengthening environmental service and resilience.   We  commend the tremendous  support  of  our  development  partners to the implementation of this strategy, especially in this difficult time where impacts of the COVID- pandemic have imposed great threat to the implementation progress of the country’s National Sustainable Development Plan. The Vanuatu Government also introduced the COVID- stimulus package with a focus on  preserving  jobs,  providing  Government  subsidies  and  commodity  support  grant, tuition  fee  exemption,  grants  for  employment  stabilization,  stabilizing  business  and trade  activities,  tax  relief,  facilitating  rural  growth  and  enabling  remittances  through labour  mobility  programs.    Recognizing  our  development  partners’  support,  the Government  has  spent  over    billion  vatu  for  this  program  and  may  require  further prudent fiscal measures to sustain the economy if the COVID- situation persists. We have re-negotiated and re-established the seasonal workers program with Australia and  New  Zealand,  a  bilateral  arrangement  where  Vanuatu  exports  labour  to  work  in farms,  hospitality  and  meat  processing  factories  in  New  Zealand  and  Australia.    The program has proven to be a success with more than 5000 Ni-Vanuatu workers recruited in the midst of the COVID- pandemic. We  started  the  COVID-  vaccination  roll out  program  towards  the  end  of  May  this year and at this point we have only vaccinated about % of the eligible population.  The  Government  is  ramping  up  efforts  across  the  country,  providing  awareness  to educate  the  citizens  on  benefits  of  the  vaccines  and  mobilize  the  masses  to  get vaccinated.    We  thank  our  major  development  partners  who  assisted  us  to  making vaccines  available  through  the  COVAX  facility.    Vaccine  access  remains  the  most critical issue for the global recovery.  Global cooperation on vaccines is required to help       prevent renewed waves of infection and the emergence of new variants, to end the health crisis sooner, and allow for faster normalization of activities in all countries. Mr. President, Vanuatu has also taken a bold step to graduate out of the LDC category on December , 2020 despite TC Harold and in the midst of COVID-.  We have done so because we believe it is the right thing to do which propels Vanuatu in a positive ‘can do’ attitude that  we  will  rise  up  and  do  all  we  can  with  courage,  boldness  and  determination  to address and cope with the natural characteristics of our existence and most importantly the  unique  nature  of  the  COVID-  pandemic  that  is  still  unraveling.    We  wish  to acknowledge the invaluable backing from UNESCAP, UNDESA, UNCTAD, EU, the Government  of  Australia,  New  Zealand,  Japan  and  China  and  other  development partners  who  are  supporting  the  implementation  of  Vanuatu’s  Smooth  Transition Strategy.    With  their  support,  Vanuatu  will  transition  smoothly  beyond  graduation  – with  new  vigor,  new  thinking  and  new  pathways  of  development  and  partnerships towards equality, resilience and environmental sustainability. I wish to also acknowledge support from the international community to successfully get  a  United  Nations  General  Assembly  resolution  which  extended  the  International Support Measures cutoff date for Vanuatu to December 2025.  This extension gives us ample time to fully recover from the impacts of TC Harold and ensuring also the full implementation of our smooth transition strategy, particularly in the targeted areas of trade, aid for trade and participation in international forums.  We need the international community to strengthen and expand the international support measures both for graduating and graduated countries.  This is especially important given the impacts of the COVID- pandemic and to build resilience in these countries to ensure smooth  transitions.    The  Graduation  Support  Facility  by  UNDESA  offering  dedicated       capacity  development  support  services  as  new  measures  of  support  to  graduated  and graduating LDCs is an excellent example.   The  facility  being  piloted  by  UNDESA  in  Vanuatu  is  supporting  us  to  implement  our Smooth Transition Strategy.  Vanuatu will share its experiences to inform the services of the facility to other graduating LDCs. I want to also highlight the need for UN agencies to improve monitoring mechanisms for graduating  and  graduated  countries,  and  provide  better  incentives  for  countries  to participate  in  that  mechanism  as  many  face  capacity  challenges.    Here,  regional  UN organizations like ESCAP could continue its support to graduating LDCs in preparing for Smooth Transition Strategies and scale up its technical assistance to graduated countries in implementing and monitoring the strategies. Human Rights and Decolonization Mr. President, As we look ahead to the future we want, we must picture a world of freedom; one that is free from predominance of colonial rule, persecution and human rights abuses. In my region, New Caledonia, French Polynesia and West Papua are still struggling for self-determination.    Drawing  attention  to  the  principle  of  “equal  rights  and  self-determination of peoples” as stipulated in the UN Charter, it is important that the UN and the  international  community  continue  to  support  the  relevant  territories,  giving  them  an equal opportunity to determine their own statehood. With recent referendum results in New Caledonia, in comparison to the 2018 results, there is now a narrower margin of votes between those voting for and against independence. It       is therefore important that the referendums remain free, fair and transparent and continue under the supervision of the United Nations.  It is in this connection that we continue to remind ourselves the people of Vanuatu of our strong cultural connection with the Umaenupne and Umaeneag islands, commonly referred to in English as Matthew and Hunter Islands.  Recognizing the incomplete process for the decolonization  of  Vanuatu,  we  hope  that  the  UN-led  process  draws  a  clear  pathway  to achieve peaceful settlement of these disputed islands. Mr. President, There  are  widespread  human  rights  violations  around  the  world.    In  my  region,  the indigenous people of West Papua continue to suffer from human rights violations.  The Pacific  Forum  and  ACP  Leaders  among  other  leaders  have  called  on  the  Indonesian Government  to  allow  the  United  Nations  Office  of  the  Human  Rights  Commissioner  to visit West Papua Province and to provide an independent assessment of the human rights situation.    To  date  there  has  been  little  progress  on  this  front.  I  hope  the  international community  through  appropriate  UN-led  process  takes  a  serious  look  at  this  issue  and address it fairly. Conclusion Mr. President, Amongst many other issues facing our world today, COVID- pandemic is undoubtedly an imminent and common threat to humanity.  To ensure global  recovery  and  building back better together, global cooperation on vaccines is very essential to allow for faster normalization of activity in all countries. The world is only resilient as the least resilient country.        The theme of the 76th session of the UN General Assembly is very fitting and points us to the very essence of the United Nations.  As imbedded in the United Nations Charter, the system was designed to be flexible to allow a myriad of challenges and unforeseen issues to be urgently addressed.   To recover from the pandemic, we need international cooperation to build back better for  a  sustainable,  inclusive  and  just  recovery.    We  must  leave  our  differences  and disagreements aside and renew our collective commitment to multilateralism.  We must combine our efforts to address our global challenges and make sure that no one is left behind. I thank you!       "
114,2021,KIR,Kiribati,"President UN Secretary General Excellencies Distinguished Delegates  Ladies and Gentlemen At the very outset allow me to share warm greetings from the Government and the people of the Republic of Kiribati.  In the name of the Almighty God, I begin by sharing his peace and blessings.  Kam na bane n Mauri! Acknowledgement  Mr. President, I join previous speakers in congratulating you, on your election to the Presidency of the 76th Session of the United Nations. I wish you every success as you  chart a new course for  a  re-vitalized  United  Nations  capable  of energizing  and  supporting the  efforts of  all nations and people, particularly those lagging behind due to the many challenges that are far beyond their economic power and means.            I also join SIDS leaders to congratulate the Government of the Republic of Maldives for inspiring our SIDs family that a small developing member state is as equally qualified as a large developed state, to lead and serve this global family. On this note, I wish to assure you of Kiribati’s full support, as you discharge your duties for  the  Assembly,  and  avail  my  Government’s  commitment  for  initiatives  that  seek  to transform our shared planet earth, into a wealthier, healthier, and safer home. This is the core  of  Kiribati’s  Vision  for    Years  (KV20)  which  is  aligned  with  our  agreed  2030 Agenda. Contextualizing the Theme  The theme is a powerful wake up call to continue to place our trust and faith in this body created  years ago with promises of a peaceful and secure home for our peoples and all living and non-living resources. Much focus leading up to the 76th UNGA has been generated on accelerating progress on UN 2030 sustainable development agenda. Yet in the onset of unprecedented challenges, a renewed focus on achieving the SDGs has been centered around recovery and building resilience, as reflected in our theme this year. Mr. President, In Kiribati, the concept of resilience is well understood. It has been the foundation of our survival, from the times of our ancestors, to this day. To build resilience, my ancestors navigated the vast Pacific Ocean, to create a wealthy, healthy and peaceful home in the  beautiful islands that have now become the sovereign Republic of Kiribati. Through challenging times, the people of Kiribati endured and remained resilient, living in peace and harmony with their environment and our friendly neighbors.  Mr. President,  Some may wonder, how the people of Kiribati managed to survive in these remote islands surrounded by a precarious and unforgiving ocean. Like our brothers and sisters across the Pacific and across our SIDS region, the people of Kiribati are people of the ocean. We have lived, thrived, and survived by caring and respecting one another, and sustain-ably managing the bountiful resources of our ocean.      Mr. President, Building resilience remains a core foundation of my government’s Vision for  Years to create a wealthier, healthier and more peaceful nation, for the people of Kiribati. We must nurture  our  people,  to  create  healthier  and  more  peaceful  communities  and  societies. Accordingly,  my  government  has  aligned  our  KV20  with  the  development  frameworks guiding our United Nations, including the 2030 Agenda, the SAMOA Pathway, and other related agreements, in a manner that prioritizes our people. Therefore, as we embark on this 76th Session of our General Assembly, I must indulge you,  Mr.  President,  to  recall  our  commitments  under  our  UN  Charter,  to  build  a  safe, peaceful and secure home for our peoples, today and in the future. To recall the hope bestowed upon us as governments, to respond to the needs of our peoples, and to re-spect our mother earth. Equally important is our commitment to maximise benefits to our people,  to  uplift  our  communities,  and  create  a  wealthier,  healthier  and  more peaceful United Nations.  Human Rights Mr. President, To ensure that sustainable development in Kiribati, is inclusive, transformative, and en-dures to “leave no one behind”, my Government is working tirelessly to reduce inequalities and mobilize targeted support to marginalized communities. As a party to a number of core Human Rights Treaties, Kiribati continues to commit to obligations to report to the Human Rights Council. I was pleased to note that Kiribati’s universal periodic review re-port was adopted at the 45th Session of the Human Rights Council in 2020. We appreci-ate  and  commend  the  very  positive  and  engaging  and  mutually  enforcing  approach adopted by the universal periodic review process that fully respects the sovereignty of a member state under review and encourages it to progress its human rights obligations at its own pace and in harmony with its traditional values and systems that are also based on the dignity and sanctity of human life.  Trade Mr. President,  Mitigating the adverse impacts of the pandemic continues to be a challenge for Kiribati due to our reliance on imported goods, including health goods and services to meet our   essential needs. Kiribati recognizes that trade policy needs to be holistic and synergized with our broader development priorities. The Government prioritizes the improvement of our digital connectivity, as digital trade holds great potential for inclusive growth and so-cio-economic development.  Responding to COVID- and adjusting to the new normal  Mr. President,  I acknowledge the support received from the United Nations and its agencies and from our  development  partners  during  this  pandemic  which  have  been  truly  instrumental  in providing vital necessities in terms of medication, food and health equipment to name but a few. I am pleased to inform that Kiribati is on the trajectory to having more than % of its population vaccinated. I am also pleased to share that more than % abroad have been safely reunited with their families. But since the discovery and outbreak of the Delta variant, our remaining nationals especially our seafarers have again been left stranded. We will continue to work tirelessly to repatriate our stranded nationals, following the pro-tocols and procedures of the countries that our nationals remain, and in line with our own national protocols.  Fisheries & Ocean  Mr. President,  Kiribati is blessed with a vast ocean that provides us with abundant resources to support our economies, and sustain our lives, our culture, and our future. Of vital importance is securing the limits of our maritime boundaries against the threats of sea-level rise and climate change. Kiribati believes that once delimitation of our maritime boundary is com-pleted and submitted to the UN Secretary-General in accordance with UNCLOS, maritime boundaries  would  remain  permanent  and  shall  not  be  affected  by  climate  change  and sea-level rise. In recognition of our commitments on biodiversity and sustainable fisheries, Kiribati was appointed the 2019 Commonwealth Blue Charter champion for sustainable coastal fish-eries. As Champion, Kiribati will lead efforts promoting collaborative research, workshops and seminars, exchange good / best practices in the practicalities of sustainable coastal fisheries, and showcase success case studies amongst Commonwealth countries.     Climate Change and Biodiversity  Mr. President, Recognizing that Kiribati remains vulnerable to Climate Change, I wish to highlight that my Government is committed to continue to build national resilience and enhance actions aligned with climate-resilient sustainable development.  Climate change and its current impacts are on-going and will continue to impact our peo-ple,  in  particular  the  most  vulnerable.  Our  resilience  as  a  global  community  is  being tested,  and  moving  on  from  this,  we  as  global  citizens  hold  the  ball  to  strengthen  the resilience of our mother earth subject to the enhanced actions that we take to ensure its sustainability and prosperous future. We need to recommit ourselves to our obligations under the Paris Agreement, by putting the needs of our peoples first, and remain guided by what is best for our people. Global issues of biodiversity and climate change are closely linked, and we cannot ad-dress one without the other. Kiribati is committed to raising ambitions for the post-2020 global biodiversity and climate change targets and I call upon leaders to join Kiribati to enhance collective efforts on this important global issue. Food Security  Mr. President,  Food Security is indeed a shared priority across all SIDS, and remains a priority under the SAMOA Pathway, as well as the Kiribati Vision for  Years Plan. Kiribati remains committed to sustainable development through food security and is very pleased to respond to the call by the UN Secretary-General, for the convening of a Food Systems Summit. The Summit dialogue can trigger the creation of robust food systems in-country and on this note I encourage fellow leaders to support this important Summit and join Kiribati and others when the Food Systems Summit officially convenes.  Conclusion  Mr. President, In conclusion, my government looks forward to work with you, as we embark on this re-newed journey of hope and faith for a wealthier, healthier and more peaceful future for all our peoples. My government offers its full support to you as you lead our collective efforts   to recover, rebuild sustainably, respond to the needs of our planet, and most importantly, respect the rights of the people of our United Nations.  Finally, let me close by sharing with us all our traditional blessings always of Te Mauri, Te Raoi ao Te Tabomoa (Health, Peace, and Properity). Thank you.      "
115,2021,MHL,Marshall Islands,"President  of the Republic  of the Marshall  lslands76th Session  of the United Nations  General AssemblyGeneral  DebateNew York   September 2021Mr. President,  Mr. Secretary-General,  Excellencies,check  against deliveryIt is my great pleasure  to bring you the warm greetings of Yokwe from the Republic ofthe Marshall  lslands.Small  and vulnerable  nations  such as my own are in dire need of a stronger UnitedNations. While we are not naive  to the difficult challenges  facing us all, we cannot  forgetthat the UN was created not only to be inclusive of global diversity, but also toceaselessly work to achieve common ideals of democracy,  free and secure  societies,and basic universal  human rights. lf we cannot remember  the mistakes  which  led to thelast century's open  global  military conflicts, than  my fear is that we are doomed  to repeatthem.Leadership  must  come  from all who are committed  to act - small and large nations  alike.We cannot  abide  by attempts  to rewrite the script on universal  human rights.  And myown Pacific islands region  faces an emerging  security threat in the form of geopoliticalcompetition by the world's  largest powers - are we again to be caught  in the middle ofa tug-of-war? Throughout my nation's young history,  we have remained true to thepursuit  of an independent  and free democracy  which  assures basic and individual  humanrights,  even as we tackle steep development  challenges.  As island  leaders, we mustremain  firmly in control of our commitment  to a free and open  lndo-Pacific,  and standapart from any who would seek to have us trade our core values for easy inducement.  Iwelcome  the recent  Japan-Pacific  lslands  Defense Dialogue  as a key confidence-building measure  against  authoritarian influence.Yet it is an open question  if the UN and international  community  can adequately speakto this emerging  threat, and if our closest traditional  partners  can answer  our call with atrue partnership  which  goes well beyond media  statements, but one which  makes  adramatic difference in our local  communities.Mr. President,The Marshall lslands remains  committed  to building a stronger  Pacific  lslands region -one which can answer to these deep challenges  to democracy, security anddevelopment, including  the threats of rising seas upon  our low-lying atoll nation. Yet themeans to address  this must be through  institutions  which place our voices  andleadership  aspirations  equal among others.  We cannot take a backseat  to our ownaffairs. Even as the Marshall  lslands is currently  transitioning  away  from the Pacificlslands Forum - under the final authority of our parliament  - we also are committed  morethan ever to joint action which advances democracy,  security  and human rights in ourregion.ln this regard,  I welcome the strengthening of the Micronesian Presidents  Summit in theNorth  Pacific,  and we look forward to forging a common voice which  addressesemerging  security  threats, and directly reflects the shared  values of our cultures anddemocratic  Constitutions.Mr. President,I support the firm commitment by the UN Secretary-General to advance UN systemreform discussions into clear management  actions. I want to underscore  the urgent  needfor tangible and text-based  efforts  towards  UN Security  Council  reform.  I am particularlypleased  to support  the opening  later this year of a new UN Multi-Country  Office  in theFederated States of Micronesia, dedicated to serve the five North Pacific  islandcountries. This is a vital opportunity  to strengthen the fragile  bridge  between  nationaland global goals,  and affords the international  system a key opportunity  to focus  on theunique structure of our nations.  We welcome  the increased focus  by the United  Nations,and commit to doing our part to better integrate UN-level assistance into nationalplanning  and implementation.  ln particular,  I also  emphasize  the importance of includingpractical assistance to address nuclear  testing impacts within the upcoming  UNSustainable Development  Cooperation Framework.Mr. President,We gather at the United Nations still in the midst  of the global  pandemic  on Covid-.The international  community still faces deep  challenges  to upscale  internationalcooperation  to supply and distribute vaccines,  particularly to the most vulnerablepeoples. However, I am pleased  to report our own robust success towards  the goal ofachieving vaccination  of nearly  every  eligible person in our nation. ln particular,  I wishto thank  the United  States  of America  for its strong and early outreach  to ensure that theMarshall lslands was not left behind in vaccination  efforts. We proudly  remain Covid-free, even as future risks  remain great.However,  our borders remain  largely closed, as we lack the full capacity to address thepotential  of even  small outbreaks. While our core economic  driver of fisheries  is onlystarting to recover,  our nation remains forced to cut back effort  in core developmentareas,  at a time when we clearly should  have  been moving forward. lt is vital that theinternational system  continue to strengthen  efforts  to social  and economic  impacts ofCovid measures  in small and remote island nations.Mr. President,Climate change remains  the greatest  threat to the seculity and well-being  of our region- especially  to low-l/ng atoll nations like my own. We simply have no higher  ground tocede.  The tireless leadership  of small island  developing  states, and wider circles ofpartners, makes clear that an overwhelming  global majority  demands the ParisAgreement  must be delivered  in actions, not empty words. This year's Conference  ofParties to the UNFCCC offers a vital opportunity for the world to make  good  on thepromises of the Paris  Agreement  to raise ambition.  We remain  in support  of the UnitedKingdom's  leadership  as host, no matter  the challenges posed by the global pandemic.We have  put forward our own commitment for stronger  action - both  on our own nationalcommitments  on emissions  and adaptation, as well as expectations for meaningfulleadership by the international maritime  sector for greater  ambition  - but we cannot actalone.  This year  is the moment  to rebuild higher ambition, and the world,  especially  themost vulnerable,  cannot afford failure  to hold temperature  rise to below  . degreesCelsius. Earlier promises of stronger climate finance  remain  unfulfilled, and even ifdelivered,  must be far more accessible  to those most in need. As sea-levels  continue  torise unabated,  there is now an immediate threshold between  unfulfilled  promises  andmeaningful  action.  A Special Rapporteur  on climate  change is needed to strengthen  thefocus and human rights  lens on those most vulnerable, where there  are often no easysolutions.  The world simply cannot delay  climate ambition any further.Mr. President,The Republic  of the Marshall  lslands  has our legacy  roots  as a strategic  UN Trusteeship,where - despite  our warnings  at the time - two Trusteeship Council  resolutions  remainthe only instance  in history where  any UN organ ever specifically authorized  nucleardetonations. This was part of a wider nuclear  weapons testing program of atmospheric  tests  conducted by the United States as administering authority,  between 946 and  958 - delivering  the equivalent  of  . Hiroshima-sized  shots every day, for years. The legacy of these tests remains  a very contemporary threat - in our waters, ourlands and our bodies. We have  recently  formed a National  Nuclear  Commission  tocoordinate effective responses,  and we continue  to view these  impacts  through a humanrights lens.Despite our commitment,  we simply  lack the capacity  to fully  address our local needs.We tirelessly  underscore that no people  or nation should ever have to bear a burdensuch as ours, and that no effort  should  be spared to move  towards a world  free of nuclearweapons and nuclear  risk, through any and all effective pathways.Mr. President,We welcome  recent progress  to restore  the UN Oceans  Summit,  now planned for nextyear to be co-hosted  by Kenya and Portugal.  We look forward to the Our Ocean  Summitnext year hosted by Palau. As a nation whose wider territory  is  percent oceans,leadership is an undeniable priority.  Global  action  on oceans cannot  be limited only topiecemeal  approaches. Far stronger  political  will is needed  - and as large ocean  nations,we are leading  by example. Joined by our regional  neighbors,  we have defined our fixedmaritime boundaries  even in the face  of rising seas. We have  worked with the Pafties tothe Nauru Agreement  to move the world towards  fully traceable  and sustainable tunastocks. As the world's  largest tuna port, we have led with our own national action  tospur sharp  progress on Covid vaccination  for foreign fishing  crews.  Together with  theForum  Fisheries Agency, we remain  committed  as a region  to ensuring basic minimumsocial  and human rights standards  for the crew, observers and vessels which fish ourwaters  and  visit our ports.  But this remains incomplete  without the stronger  commitmentfrom distant water  fishing nations, many of whom are also global superpowers.  Humanrights  apply  in the ocean  - without  exception  - just as much as they apply on land.Mr. President,More than  years  after the Universal  Declaration  on Human  Rights, the world remainsat a loss to turn these  aspirations  into realities. There are many complex rights situationsaround the world  which deserve  more careful attention and diplomacy than genericapproaches  can afford.  Yet far too often, nations seek to avoid accountability,  and tryto hide behind political muscle or use sovereignty,  colonial legacies  or developmentchallenges as excuses for forced disappearances,  extrajudicial  killings or to suppressbasic political expression. This is simply not a ""win-win"" solution for anyone.On the basis of our own history and experience, we remain  committed  to ensuring  thevoices  of the most vulnerable  are better  heard. The international  community should havelearned from far too many  prior mistakes  that politics must not cloud our judgement  norbe a barrier to action. On Myanmar,  the General Assembly has spoken loudly  byadopting Resolution /287 earlier this year, with only one objection,  urging the armedforces to halt lethal force and respect  the free will of the people.In addition, the Marshall lslands is proud to have  joined cross-regional joint statementsat the UN General Assembly and the Human  Rights  Council expressing strong  concernregarding human rights  issues  in the Xianxing  region of the People's  Republic of Chinaas well as recent  developments  in Hong Kong. lf a truly  independent  visit by the UNHigh Commissioner  for Human Rights  still remains  unscheduled,  we would stronglyencourage all available options to be pursued to deepen the HRC's analysis andassessment.Mr. President,The devastating  global  Covid pandemic  demands  collective  action from all countries,stakeholders  and peoples,  if we are to achieve a resilient  recovery.  The democraticgovernment of Taiwan should be allowed  to participate  in an equal and dignified mannerwithin the UN system, including the WHO, ICAO  and the UNFCCC,  as well as activitiesrelated  to the SDGs.  There is absolutely nothing  in General Assembly  resolution  2758which  prevents  this inclusive approach, and this resolution affords nothing to hidebehind, as it expresses no position  on Taiwan. As a people-centric  institution,  the UNcannot ignore the Taiwanese  people  or continue to use their nationality  to exclude  themfrom attending public meetings  or public tours  at it's headquarters.  The shameful  silencemust end.Mr. President,To effectively  address the grave challenges  before  us all, the international communityneeds strong leadership  and  true commitment to human rights  and security.  lt is evidentto allthat a major course  correction  is required  to rebuild politicaltrust  and cooperation.Yet this challenge  also offers a vital opportunity to reshape the world closer to thecommon values  of democratic freedom embedded  in the UN Charter.Thank  you and kommol  tata."
116,2021,FSM,Micronesia (Federated States of),"President David W. Panuelo before the United Nations General Assembly at its seventy-sixth session New York,  September 2021       Check against delivery Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, Excellencies, Distinguished delegates, Ladies and gentlemen, I bring you warm greetings from our beautiful islands in the Federated States of Micronesia. Mr. President,  At the outset, I wish to express that I am particularly pleased that an esteemed leader from a small island developing state (SIDS) has been elected to lead this august body during this crucial 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly.  Your country, the Republic of the Maldives, has been instrumental and effective in leading the world community, particularly on issues relating to the environment and Climate Change, to find common ground. I note with genuine enthusiasm that both of our countries have undertaken partnerships with the Blue Prosperity Coalition to protect at least % of our ocean, and that both of our countries, like small island developing states across the World, are committed to building back better through tackling Climate Change. I am thankful and heartened by your leadership and your country’s willingness to undertake an even greater commitment to lead this Assembly during these challenging times.   I would also like to pay tribute to the outgoing President of the 75th Session, His Excellency Mr. Volkan Bozkir for his leadership during an unusual and trying time.  As always, we are grateful to our Secretary-General, and my dear friend, Antonio Guterres, who has worked unceasingly to make our United Nations a more effective instrument for the advancement of our common goals. He has the total support of Micronesia and its people, and we congratulate him on his re-election as Secretary-General. Mr. President, The theme of this year’s session, “building resilience through hope – to recover from COVID-, rebuild sustainably,  respond  to  the  needs  of  the  planet,  respect  the  right  of  the  people,  and  revitalize  the  United Nations,” is both bold and appropriate.   Crucially, the colors of this year’s theme are all part of the portrait of where we are today. At its foundation, we                                  must respect ourselves the same as we respect others, for an infringement on the rights of one person is an infringement on the rights of us all. We must respond to the environmental needs of the Planet, for the Planet’s needs  are  our  needs.  We  must  recover  from  COVID-,  and  rebuild  sustainably,  which  will  ensure humankind’s resilience for the remainder of the Decade of Action. And to ensure we have hope, to ensure we have unity, we must revitalize the United Nations. Mr. President, Micronesia remains COVID- free. We have been able to keep the virus at bay by locking down our borders, and by embracing a very close partnership with both the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention. Thanks to generous support from the United States of America, with whom we share an Enduring Partnership, we have received enough vaccines for our entire population. More than % of our adult population has received the first dose of the vaccine, and we are just starting to vaccinate adolescents. Meanwhile, thanks to generous support from the People’s Republic of China, with whom we share a Great Friendship, we have established highly functional quarantine sites across our Nation. Though COVID- is not on our shores, the Pandemic has nonetheless effected our people. While I can point out economic data on lost jobs, delays on implementing infrastructure projects, and so forth, perhaps the most meaningful is that by keeping our Nation protected we have also necessarily kept many of our citizens stranded abroad. While repatriation efforts are ongoing, inclusive of pre-quarantine outside Micronesia and in-country quarantine upon arrival, there are still hundreds of families missing their loved ones. To all the Micronesian men and women still stranded abroad, I give you all my word that we will get you home. Let us build back better health security today to prepare for the next Pandemic tomorrow. Let us all commit to the goals of ending the COVID- Pandemic, and creating a stronger health security architecture in 2022. Let us all support the targets for achieving global health security, and let us all elevate global ambition to making shared existential security threats, whether they are the COVID- Pandemic or Climate Change, a shared responsibility, that we work together in addressing as nations united for a common purpose. Mr. President, Regrettably, the chilling confirmation from the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its recent report is a stark reminder that dark days are ahead if no serious and urgent action is taken to deal with the Climate Change crisis. We can no longer worry about whether we have a developing label or a developed label next to our name.  We are all in this together, and we must all do our part. The science is clear that both developing and developed countries are affected.   Micronesia remains committed to doing its part in addressing the Climate Change crisis so we can build back better. With Blue Prosperity Micronesia, we are seeking to protect % of our Nation’s ocean territory. With the Micronesia Challenge, we are seeking to protect % of our coastal and terrestrial territory. With recent legislation, we have banned the importation of most forms of plastic, and we are beginning to shift from relying on fossil fuels to renewable energies like solar. What Micronesia needs from our friends, allies, and development partners in the global community—and that includes everyone watching me today, because Micronesia is family to the United States and a friend to the People’s Republic of China, just as Micronesia is a friend to the Maldives and to the United Kingdom, to the Netherlands and to Spain, to Nicaragua and to Australia, to New Zealand and to South Africa, to Israel and to Norway, to Japan and to Korea—what we need is global action today for our World’s prosperity tomorrow.              Mr. President, We must look past what separates us, and focus on what unites us. The positive step undertaken by the United States to rejoining the Paris Agreement and sponsoring a Climate Summit is all very encouraging, because the World needs the United States if we are to solve the Climate Change crisis, on the premise that the World needs every country to work together. The World needs the United States, just as the World needs China, as the World needs Japan, as the World needs Australia, to all come together for global survival. The secret to the threat of Climate Change is the same as the secret to the threat of the COVID- Pandemic. The moment we decide that the threat is a specific country or a specific person, then we all lose. The way that we all win is cooperating together. Micronesia is willing to do its part, and is actively doing its part. We ask all of our friends, allies, and development partners to join us today. Today, we encourage all countries to be bold, and submit more ambitious revised Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs). Mr. President, While we took encouragement from the international response to the Paris Agreement, the Climate Crisis should also motivate us to ratify and integrate the Kigali Amendment into our national policies to ensure the avoidance  of  life-threatening  damage  to  our  planet.    That  is  why  I  am  urging  countries  which  are  major contributors  to  carbon  emissions  to ratify the Kigali Amendment, and to phase down the production and consumption of HFCs.   Mr. President, The presence and utilization of the rule of law is the true barometer for civilization. Micronesia has been taking many steps to strengthen the rule of law in our country. We are seeking to pass legislation on cybercrimes, we will be joining the International Police Organization (INTERPOL), and we have committed to tackling illegal, unregulated, and unreported fishing in our waters in cooperation with organizations like the Forum Fisheries Agency and the Micronesian Presidents Summit. We have strengthened maritime surveillance with Australia and Japan, and look forward to the receipt of two new Guardian-class patrol ships, or vessels, from Australia to help us protect our Big Ocean State. Yet, of all the actions most important for Micronesia’s continued capacity to promote and protect the rule of law, it is through our Enduring Partnership with the United States of America, which is codified through the Compact of Free Association. Negotiations over the expiring provisions of the Compact are ongoing, and in light  of  the  recent  High-Level  Defense  Talks  this  July,  Micronesia  calls  on  the  United  States  to  help  us conclude our negotiations before the current agreements are set to expire at the end of 2023.  Mr. President, The Federated States of Micronesia accepts the responsibility to continue to speak out, along with similarly committed States, on how the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (""UNCLOS"") applies to maritime zones in situations involving Climate Change-related Sea-Level Rise. Last month, the Pacific Islands countries endorsed a landmark Declaration on Preserving Maritime Zones in the Face of Climate Change-related  Sea-Level  Rise,  which  has  been  affirmed  by both the Pacific Islands Forum and the Micronesian Presidents’  Summit.   The  Declaration  is  a  formal  statement  of  the  views  of  these  island  countries.  As recognized by the Declaration, the threat of Climate Change-related Sea-Level Rise is, and I quote, a ""defining issue that imperils the livelihoods and wellbeing of our peoples and undermines the realization of a peaceful, secure, and sustainable future for our region"" of the Pacific.   Recent reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change underscore that global sea-level rise associated with Climate Change is likely to be as high as one meter by the end of this century, with the Western              Pacific having already experienced three times more sea-level rise than the current global mean. Many of us, like my own country, Micronesia, sit in this region of the Pacific. In light of these circumstances, and in acknowledgement of the potential legal implications of sea-level rise on maritime zonesm such as those of Micronesia, the Declaration proclaims, among other things, that our islands’ ""maritime zones, once established in accordance with the UNCLOS and notified to the Secretary-General of the United Nations in accordance with UNCLOS, and the rights and entitlements that flow from them, shall continue  to  apply,  notwithstanding  any  physical changes connected to Climate Change-related Sea-Level Rise.""  It will be deeply unjust and inequitable if a small island developing State like Micronesia, being specially affected  by  Climate  Change-related  Sea-Level  Rise,  despite  being  among  the  least  responsible  for  the phenomenon,  has  to  surrender  any  of  its  maritime  rights  and  entitlements  because  of  such sea-level rise, including its rights and entitlements to rich fishery resources in our Exclusive Economic Zone.  Fortunately, the Pacific islands’ collective views as expressed in the Declaration are supported by both UNCLOS and the legal principles underpinning it.  Micronesia reiterates its endorsement of the Declaration and encourages the international community to favorably consider the Declaration and its overarching objectives. Mr. President,  As a nation covering over a million square miles of ocean, we attach great importance to the sustainable use and management of marine resources within and adjacent to our territorial waters. Our people have lived in harmony with the Ocean and their natural environment since our ancestors began to navigate these vast seas. We have relied on the traditional knowledge in conserving our land and seas, and will continue to look to it for best practices in preserving the resources that come from the Ocean, and also utilize it to fight Climate Change. Micronesia will continue to advocate for more effective conservation of our marine and forest resources. Our traditions dictate it, and our survival requires it. Long before the terms “marine sanctuaries” and “marine protected areas” (MPAs) became everyday terms with our people, the concepts have already existed throughout many of our traditional Micronesian societies.  Through these various initiatives Micronesia is currently engaged in, such as the Micronesia Challenge 2030, Blue Prosperity Micronesia, and the Technology for Tuna Transparency (T3) Challenge, we are investing in our future. With biodiversity around our planet at risk and in serious decline, Micronesia and its partners are taking concrete actions. We must step up collectively and do more to protect and restore our planet’s biodiversity. I encourage all who wish to stand with us to do so, as Micronesia will show you peace, friendship, cooperation, and love in our common humanity. Mr. President, I  commend  the  Secretary-General  for  taking  the  initiative  to  convene  the  United  Nations  Food  Systems Summit, which will be held at the end of this General Assembly. The focus on food systems, in all its aspects, from production to processing, and from consumption to waste utilization, recognizes the integral role that food plays in our lives, in our health, our livelihood, our economy, and our environment. In the dialogues leading up to the forthcoming Food Systems Summit, we have been seeing a surge of community-level awareness and commitment  to  address  consumption  behavior  to  address  the  ravages  of  food-related  non-communicable diseases. Approximately one third of Micronesians suffer from diabetes and high-blood pressure, largely as a direct result for our recent social preferences for highly processed, and salty, imported foods. Our current food system is unsustainable, and so we are trying to change it, to re-indigenize it, as part of our commitment to the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and the Decade of Action.                Mr. President, The effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has always been at the top of our agenda.  In the North Pacific, we are fully aware that the UN system’s commitment and support on the ground is necessary if we are to achieve many of the goals.  We, therefore, warmly welcome the imminent opening of the new UN Multi-Country Office for the North Pacific, with Micronesia as its host. The countries of the North Pacific are most grateful to our Secretary-General for his foresight and decision to open this new office. As host, I pledge my country’s full support, and we commit to doing our part in ensuring the expedited entry into the country of the international staff of the new MCO. The reform of the United Nations Development system has shown promising results. Its success remains in the hands of our Organization’s membership.  It is time to rethink how best we, as members, can provide funding support to the system.  We have to ensure that adequate and sustainable financing is available to support the responses from the Resident Coordinators to the needs of the most vulnerable. Mr. President, The reform of our United Nations, in particular the reform of the UN Security Council, remains a relevant subject of discussion year after year.  We must recommit to completing the unfinished work which has eluded us  for  decades.  It  is  appropriate  that  members  of  this  august  body  that  have  contributed  so  much  to  our Organization, such as Japan, be included as permanent members on a reformed Council. Mr. President,  I conclude by applauding the United Nations for its continued efforts to unite the nations of our World, and encourage the United Nations to continue to live up to its responsibility in ensuring that no society or people are left behind. Micronesia has faith in the United Nations, and will actively work to ensure that the United Nations is successful. I further conclude by explicitly calling on all Nations and Peoples who hear me today to know that the People and Government of Micronesia extends to you friendship, and urges you to take action to extend that same friendship and love to your fellow human beings. There are real challenges facing us all today, and we find ourselves wishing we could live in a better world. But a better world is not something we ask for. A better world is something we build. We define a better world through consensus, with a foundation of empathy and love for other human beings. We construct a better world by acknowledging that we are who we choose to be, and then choosing to take responsibility for both ourselves and our communities. Micronesia chooses to take responsibility for solving the Climate Change crisis and for ending the COVID- Pandemic. We cannot do it alone. We need you, all of you, to stand with us, as nations united, to take actions today for our global prosperity tomorrow. Thank you, Mr. President, and God Bless our United Nations.                "
117,2021,NRU,Nauru,"President of the Republic of Nauru United Nations General Debate of the 76th session   2021 Mr. President,  It is an honor to address the opening of the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly (albeit virtually rather than in-person once again).  On behalf of the Republic of Nauru, I would like to congratulate Your Excellency, Mr. Abdulla Shahid on your recent assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly. Let me assure you of  my  delegation’s  full  cooperation  and  support  as  you  steer  our  important  work  during  this session. It is heartwarming to see a fellow islander take on this prestigious role, bringing our shared challenges,  resilience,  and  the  vibrancy  of  big  ocean  states  to  the  forefront  of  the  work  of  the General Assembly.  I would also like to thank His Excellency Mr. Volkan Bozkir for his exceptional stewardship of this august body during the 75th anniversary session.  Mr. President,  This  past  year  has  truly  been  a  turning  point  for  the  United  Nations,  marked  by  a  historic anniversary and marred by disasters, conflict, and untold human suffering, all of which have been multiplied by the COVID- pandemic. In order to overcome these adversaries, we must remain hopeful, and the hope for our shared humanity must inspire bold action.  The obstacles facing the global community now in many ways mirror the history of Nauru. We have survived epidemics that decimated our population, rebuilt and recovered from the scourge of the  World  Wars,  overcome  exploitation,  and  have  experienced  great  prosperity  and  great  loss.   Persevering through it all with the lesson that we are all deeply connected and that an outbreak in one corner of the world can produce a ripple of destruction that touches us all.  Recognizing that we are all bound together, we must all work to change course and deliver on the promise of multilateralism: an effective and robust United Nations that is fit for purpose, capable of tackling the challenges of today and the future, to build a safer, sustainable world for generations to come. A world that realizes the promise of peace, human rights and sustainable development for  all  and  shifts  away  from  the  current  trend  of  increasing  violent  conflict  around  the  world. Previous approaches have not left the world safer, and it is time to re-commit to the vision of the 2030 Agenda. Mr. President, This forum, which reflects the views of every Member State, has the capability to chart our path towards  a  resilient,  just,  and  equitable  world.  Nauru  as  one  of  the  smallest  member  of  the  UN family and one of the most vulnerable, is committed to multilateralism as our only way forward together, though we must open our eyes to the reality of its current failures and act to implement our  historic  agreements  across  many  issues  like  sustainable  development,  climate  change, development finance, and more. The policies and plans to avert further catastrophes have been negotiated and adopted in the UN’s hallow halls only to meet lackluster implementation attempts and sit idly on bookshelves and in hard drives while the world moves on and battles new crises and shocks.  As such we applaud the efforts of the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Antonio Guterres, to spearhead a revamped and reinvigorated United Nations as detailed in his report on Our Common Agenda and in principle support many of the proposals contained therewith.  Mr. President,  Inequality is growing at a rapid pace, with the pandemic deepening divisions between and within countries. Nauru is not exempt from this, and COVID- has only exacerbated our isolation from the global community. We have remained in a state of emergency since March 2020. The national COVID-  Taskforce  has  worked  tirelessly  under  a  whole-of-government  approach  involving communities, the private sector, and civil society.    Through the Grace of God – we remain COVID free today. One of five countries to have this distinction.  For Nauru, and our small population of ,000, with limited health infrastructure, our best defense against the virus is our closed borders and a capture and contain policy. However, this does not mean that we have been spared the far-reaching impacts of the pandemic.  Emergency measures and costs are growing unceasingly. As a country reliant on imported goods, including produce and other foods, the challenge of supply accessibility is a stark reality.  Mr. President, What we need to safely combat COVID- and begin to reopen our economy is equitable and timely access to safe, effective, and affordable vaccines. It is clear that no one is safe until we are all  vaccinated  everywhere.  Yet,  despite  this  knowledge  access  to  vaccine  remains  elusive  and uneven. We cannot afford to leave anyone behind. Therefore, we support the Secretary-General’s proposal for an Emergency Platform, and a global vaccination plan.  The COVID- pandemic poses a grave threat to the health systems of Small Island Developing States (SIDS). It is of the utmost importance that we can access COVID- prevention, mitigation, and treatment interventions; and essential, safe, affordable, effective, and quality medicines and vaccines to prevent, contain and stop transmission of the virus.  In Nauru, with the support of the COVID- Tools Accelerator and our development partners we have  successfully  vaccinated  our  entire  adult  population.  Despite  this  achievement  our  island remains at risk and unable to lift emergency measures without access to vaccines for young people, twelve to eighteen. Our small population size and lack of case numbers mean we have been shut out of qualifying and accessing any additional vaccines. While we have taken the first steps to protecting  our  people,  we  cannot  achieve  full  vaccination  and  effectively  protect  our  country without the support of the international community and equitable access.  Our  efforts  to  respond  to  COVID-  and  vaccinate  our  people  would  not  have  been  possible without the valuable support provided by our partners. We are truly grateful to our genuine friends Australia, India, Japan and Republic of China (Taiwan), for their ongoing assistance.      Mr. President,  We  call  on  the  United  Nations  to  embrace  willing  and  able  partners  like  Taiwan  who  share common global challenges, and to ensure that the people of the Republic of China (Taiwan) enjoy the same rights as the peoples of other nations. The United Nations must live up to its ideals of universality and equality, respecting the worth of every individual. Taiwan is an important partner in the global response to this pandemic, and its exemplary response to the global pandemic should not be ignored. Taiwan is ready to share their experience and aspire to do so by joining the World Health  Assembly.  Taiwan  should  have  the  right  to  participate  as  an  equal  partner  in  the implementation of the SDGs as they have demonstrated their ability and supported many in the SDG fields. They should also be part of “Our Common Agenda” vision. Mr. President,  A UN . with a renewed social contract must ensure that no one is left behind. including those in SIDS and in the Pacific.  We  welcome  the  ongoing  progress  of  the  Multi-country  office  in  the  North  Pacific.  The  UN Resident Coordinator system provides invaluable support to our countries. The system must be backed up by predictable and adequate funding. We call on our partners to continue to support the reinvigorated resident coordinator system through more predictable sources of financing. With the unprecedented challenges of COVID- and the climate crisis we are in, it is even more important that we have a resident coordinator system that is well funded and fully operationalized.  Ensuring sustainable financing is critical to recovering better. Nauru, like many SIDS face barriers to  sustained  economic  growth  due  to  our  geographic  remoteness,  small  scale  of  our  economy, vulnerabilities to climate change, external economic and financial shocks and the rules that govern development assistance.  For  years  SIDS  have  reiterated  the  limitations  of  the  per  capita  income  as  a  measure  of development. This arbitrary measure does not adequately consider our special circumstances and unique vulnerabilities.  Nauru was recently reclassified as a High-Income Country – this classification for us and many island  nations  renders  us  ineligible  to  access  concessional  financing.  Therefore,  if  structural   obstacles and our unique vulnerabilities are not considered and appropriately addressed, the goals of  the  SAMOA  Pathway  and  the  full  achievement  of  the  2030  Agenda  will  continue  to  be compromised.  We  welcome  the  ongoing  work  on  the  Multi-Dimensional  Vulnerability  Index (MVI)  and  reiterate  the  importance  of  its  establishment,  so  countries  like  Nauru  can  access concessional finance. As such we welcome the Secretary-Generals proposal to find more holistic measurements and assessments of progress and development beyond GDP and will work closely to  ensure  that  the  concerns  and  realities  of  SIDS  are  reflected  in  the  development  of  any complementary metric.  Fulfilling the financing promises made in the SAMOA Pathway, 2030 Agenda, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, and the Paris Agreement is vital to the full and effective implementation of those historic agreements. Without adequate and predictable support from the international community Nauru and many island nations will not be able to realize the Sustainable Development Goals, nor to adapt, and mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change.  Mr. President,  We  must  end  our  war  on  nature  and  address  the  droughts,  floods,  fires,  famine  and  more  that climate change has provoked. Despite the undeniable impacts touching every corner of the world, we are faced with the harsh truth that funding for the root causes of climate change is exponentially greater than funding for our response.  Climate  change  is  the  greatest  threat  to  our  shared  future,  to  people,  the  planet,  peace,  and prosperity. Nauru, alongside our neighbors in the Pacific echo the alarm raised by the recent findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and its “code red for humanity”. We are undertaking ambitious actions in Nauru to address the climate crisis, but we cannot do it alone. Leaders and nations everywhere must act; and act swiftly and decisively to close the widening emissions gap and keep rising temperatures well below .C goal.  The lived realities of climate change have been with many of our countries for some time now. Climate change undermines and threatens the ability of Governments and institutions to deliver basic services such as food and water. The pandemic has met the increasing impacts of climate change  and  multiplied  them  with  rising  inequalities  and  economic  regressions,  the  resulting   dangerous blend weakens the ability of any one Government to protect the safety and security of its  citizens,  risking  social  and  political  unrest.  The  security  implications  of  climate  change  are transboundary in nature and require a multilateral response.  We  will  continue  to  advocate  for  a  new  Office  for  a  Special  Representative  of  the  Secretary-General on Climate and Security.  Climate change has crept into every facet and sector of life from the air we breathe, to the food we eat, to the homes we live in, and our response must be equally diverse and comprehensive. The United Nations and its Member States must take urgent action, protecting the security of the most vulnerable countries and communities, ensuring that our beloved green and blue planet does not turn red.  We  are  fast  approaching  COP26,  and  an  opportunity  that  must  be  utilized  to  stem  the  current record-breaking period of extreme weather and climate disasters. We must follow the science with real effort and not empty pledges.  We call upon the G20 to phase out all fossil fuel subsidies by 2023 and accelerate actions towards transitioning to low Greenhouse Gas emission, climate-resilient economies, in line with Article ()()(c) of the Paris Agreement. We also call on the G20 to take into consideration environmental and social safeguards in their energy systems to have long-term and sustainable alignment to the Paris Agreement.  We have a precious window to repair and renew our relationship with the planet and we must make these opportunities count.  Mr. President,  Nauru is a big ocean state. As people of the ocean, our lives are inextricably linked and connected to the Pacific Ocean. The ocean has shaped who we are, and our commitment to its responsible stewardship.  Nauru  recognizes  the  United  Nations  Convention  on  the  Law  of  the  Sea  (UNCLOS)  as  the overarching treaty governing access and use of the ocean and its resources. We have enjoyed the benefits  of  our  large  exclusive  economic  zone  and  under  the  Parties  to  the  Nauru  Agreement (PNA), and alongside our neighbors we have successfully managed highly migratory tuna stocks   at  sustainable  levels.  Our  strong  regional  cooperation  has  also  been  recognized  globally  as  an example of best management practices of living ocean resources.  Building  upon  our  strong  regional  ties  Nauru  was  proud  to  host  the  Micronesian  President’s Summit just recently, which endorsed the Naoero Communique on strengthened cooperation on several  areas  related  to  regional  security  resulting  from  climate  change  and  sea-level  rise, transnational  crime,  and  illegal,  unreported  and  unregulated  fishing.  We  agreed  to  develop  a subregional  strategy  to  address  these  issues  to  ensure  the  continued  security  and  safety  of  the Micronesian peoples into the future.  Mr. President,  We  are  committed  to  the  Rule  of  Law  in  ocean  affairs  and  to  effective  cooperation  and implementation of UNCLOS and Nauru made a decision to invoke Section , Paragraph  of the 1994 Agreement, initiating the process to complete the Exploitation (Mining) Code within the next two years under the mandate of the International Seabed Authority (ISA). This process will allow Nauru,  and  other  developing  countries  to  participate  in  a  new  industry,  accessing  valuable resources  in  light  of  a  historical  context  that  far  too  often  deprived  developing  countries  from reaping the benefits.  We  look  forward  to  working  closely  with  ISA  members  and  observers  to  complete  the  draft Exploitation Code within two years and develop environmental regulations that help ensure any exploitation and seafloor collection operations are conducted safely and responsibly. I thank our partners who have been supporting countries like mine build their capacity in this regard. Accessing these polymetallic nodule resources is critical to building the clean energy transition we need and towards a circular economy. These polymetallic nodules are needed to transform big and small countries energy systems and support our fight against the climate crisis.  Mr. President,  I am pleased to join this debate and the focus placed on looking forward towards a UN fit for purpose to meet the challenges that lie ahead, and with an emphasis on the youth of today and future generations.     Nauru  looks  toward  the  future  with  the  guide  of  the  2030  Agenda,  the  SDGs  and  our  national plans. Education and capacity building remain priorities and key areas of investment to ensure that young Nauruans have a quality education accessible to all, that provides a platform for sustainable livelihoods. As such we welcome the proposal for a Transforming Education Summit in 2022 and coalition  to  promote  and  track  green  jobs  and  career  paths  for  youth.  We  also  welcome  the establishment  of  the  President  of  the  General  Assembly’s  Youth  Fellowship  Programme,  in particular  the  focus  on  building  capacity  for  young  professionals  from  countries  in  special situations.  Mr. President,  I will conclude in hope for our ability to come together in solidarity, to overcome COVID-, address  climate  change  and  achieve  equality.  ‘Let’s  hand-in  hand,  shoulder-to-shoulder,’  as Scripture guides us, ‘walk forward to meet the challenges of tomorrow.’ Together we can deliver for we the peoples. May God bless the Republic of Nauru and may God bless the United Nations.   "
118,2021,PLW,Palau,"President of the Republic of Palau General Debate of the 76th Session  of the United Nations General Assembly  September 2021, New York Mr. President, Mr. Secretary General, Excellencies, Ladies, and Gentlemen, it is a privilege to speak before this esteemed body for the first time. I bring warm greetings from the people of the Republic of Palau. My sincere congratulations to Mr. Abdulla Shahid on your election as President of the 76th session, and I commend Mr. Volkan Bozkir on his leadership during the previous session.   Ladies  and  gentlemen,  our  76th  session  convenes  at  a  unique  time  in  United Nations’ history. Member states are still confronted with the monumental task of solving the COVID- pandemic. On behalf of the people of Palau, we applaud and salute the first  responders,  doctors,  nurses,  public  health  professionals,  and  all  those  who  have worked  and  continue  to  diligently  respond  to  this  pandemic;  including  the  scientists, pharmaceutical companies, civil society, governments, and all others who have taken the lead in creating lifesaving vaccines and innovative treatments in swift response. Palau would also like to thank all our international allies and friends who came to our aid during this difficult time, especially the United States, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia who delivered COVID- vaccines, PPE, testing capacity, and vital training to the people      Check Against Delivery of  Palau,  which  allowed  us  to  remain  COVID-free  through  most  of  this  pandemic,  and now  COVID-safe  with  over  %  of  our  total  population  fully  vaccinated  and  with  zero deaths or hospitalizations. The people of Palau are eternally grateful for your friendship, generosity, and cooperation.  Along  these  lines,  we  would  like  to  highlight  the  Republic  of  China  -Taiwan’s leadership in the global response against COVID-. Not only have they demonstrated consistent  and  effective  management  of  the  pandemic  within  their  borders,  but  their leadership  has  also  extended  to  Palau.  Taiwan’s  international  response  facilitated cooperation and implementation of an effective sterile travel corridor between Taiwan and Palau.  This  sterile  corridor  has  allowed  Taiwan  and  Palau  to  resume  medical  and educational  cooperation,  and  recoup  economic  engagement  and  other  benefits  of international  travel.  We  encourage  the  UN  system  to  accept  Taiwan  as  a  valuable contributor to our collective efforts and strongly advocate for Taiwan’s participation in the UN system.   On  behalf  of  the  People  of  Palau,  we  also  extend  our  deepest  condolences  to those whose lives have been impacted by the pandemic; our prayers go out to you and your  loved  ones.    We  also  pray  that  we’ll  further band  together  to  find  more  equitable approaches to subdue the pandemic, and continue the healing and economic recoveries of our people, communities and nations. Ladies  and  gentlemen,  if  there  is  to  be  a  silver  lining  in  this  pandemic,  it’s  the strength of human resolve. In record time, we mobilized global resources and information to  send  protective  equipment  around  the  world,  and  created  numerous  vaccines  and treatments to counteract the COVID- virus. Although more can and must be done in    Check Against Delivery our  efforts  to  contain  the  pandemic,  the  global  community  responded  to  the  threat  of despair  by  taking action, and  working at  break-neck  speed  to  contain the  coronavirus.  Today, I ask our global community to take the same level of urgency and bold action in responding to the existential threat of climate change.  In April of this year, Palau, which historically is outside the Pacific Typhoon Belt, was  hit  by  Typhoon  Surigae,  our  3rd  typhoon  since  2012,  which  damaged  %  of  our homes,  and  destroyed  major  infrastructure,  including  our  aquaculture  facilities.  It  also destroyed  millions  of  dollars  in  crops,  and  wreaked  significant  havoc  on  our  reefs  and corals,  consequently  undermining  Palau’s  food  security.  This  is  particularly  notable because Palau and other SIDS depend on imported and highly processed food products due  to  lack  of  economies  of  scale  as  a  result  of  our  small  populations,  resulting  in significant increases in NCDs among our people.  While there is potential for increased local  production,  our  efforts  are  hampered  by  the  adverse  impacts  of  climate  change including rising sea levels, typhoons, droughts and other stress on marine and terrestrial ecosystems.  The gradual destruction of climate change has allowed us to be complacent and to respond by kicking the can down the road.    However, ladies and gentlemen, the IPCC Report has indicated that we are running out of time. Simply put, we must act NOW to ensure  our  children  inherit  a  healthy  and  reliable  future.  We  need  to  act  NOW  before further irreparable damage is made to our planet. As a SIDS nation, we stand here as one of the States most vulnerable to climate change, and we urge fast and comprehensive multilateral action to mitigate the effects of climate change.     Check Against Delivery Ocean-based  climate  action  can  play  a  significant  role  in  shrinking  the  world’s carbon footprint. The Ocean Panel has commissioned research that found ocean-based climate  action  can deliver up  to  a  fifth  (%)  of the  annual greenhouse  gas  emissions cuts needed to limit global temperature rise to . degrees Celsius by 2050.  One of our major issues in addressing the risks of climate change and the climate-ocean  nexus  is  our  inability  and  lack  of  capacity  in  accessing  climate  financing.  This further exacerbates our vulnerabilities, and we are not alone in this respect. Of the % of  climate  financing  provided  on  adaption,  ONLY  %  of  that  support  went  to  SIDS countries. Further, of that %, at least half of those funds were not in the form of grants, but in the form of loans. We urge the UN to address this inequity and reduce the artificial barriers to allowing small countries to access climate finance, and for the UN to create systems that address its Charter to represent “We the peoples”- for all people. As  a  SIDS  country,  Palau  relies  heavily  on  the  ocean  -  not  only  as  its  main economic engine via tourism and fisheries, but also for its food security.   A recent study on the Palau National Marine Sanctuary (PNMS) by Stanford University stated that rising temperatures will produce warmer waters that hold less oxygen.  These twin pressures will cause tuna and billfish that have particularly high oxygen requirements to migrate, in search of areas with cooler waters and higher oxygen concentrations.  These  analyses project a % decline in skipjack and yellowfin biomass in Palau’s waters by 2100 if we continue on this high emissions trajectory.  As Palau prepares to host the 7th Our Ocean Conference in February 2022, we reaffirm our commitment to sustainably manage, use and conserve our oceans.  In 2015, we  declared  most  of  our  EEZ  as  the  Palau  National  Marine  Sanctuary,  but  this  is  not    Check Against Delivery enough.  We  need  global  action.  It’s  time  that  the  international  community  commits  to establishing  a  %  target  that  focuses  on  marine  protected  areas  within  and  beyond national jurisdictions.  Mr. President, many of the challenges that will be presented here this week must be addressed within the framework of the United Nations as the custodian of the world. To this point, Palau is undergoing a renewal of its Compact of Free Association (COFA) with  the  United  States.  This  relationship  was  the  result  of  the  UN’s  historic  role  in assigning  trusteeship  to  the  U.S.  to  administer  our  islands  as  part  of  a  strategic  trust territory,  with  the  duty  of  developing  the  territory  into  full  self-government  and  self-reliance.   After seven () referendums, the People  of  Palau  agreed  to  the  Compact  of Free  Association  in  1994,  allowing  the  U.S.  to  exercise  fundamental  elements  of  our national sovereignty: control of our national security and defense. This enabled the U.S. to deny other nations access to our lands and waters, ultimately restricting our association with  some  members  of  the  international  community  and  limiting  prospective  economic development opportunities.   In this regard, previous COFA reconsiderations have been unsuccessful because of inadequate regard of the complex dynamics of the modern world and the compounding vulnerabilities  Palau  is  challenged  with.  Regardless,  I  am  confident  that  the  new  U.S. administration  will  rise  to  the  task  and  correct  the  deficiencies  in  our  previous deliberations. Ladies  and  Gentlemen,  as  the  eldest  or  “big  brother”  in  my  family,  the  safety, security and well-being of my siblings was ultimately my responsibility.  We grew up in our community as a collective unit whereby “I” was always synonymous with “we.” This    Check Against Delivery reassured us that no one would be left out and reinforced the principle that each of us reflected  the  stability  and  character  of  the  family  and  extended  community.    This  is  a fundamental Palauan principle which I believe signifies the Pacific way and reflects  the UN system.  Mr.  President,  this  family,  the  United  Nations,  has  an  opportunity  to  reconcile global issues and, through its collective membership, take actions necessary to develop and implement innovative and crucial solutions. This is our mandate, and we must not fail.  In Palau, many different fishes of the ocean are painted on our traditional Chiefs meeting  houses (“Abai”) -  sharks  symbolizing  bravery,  stingrays  symbolizing steadfastness, and the Surgeon fish (“Mesekuuk”) symbolizing unity. The Surgeon fish represents  a  unique  characteristic.  They  are  grazers  and  roam  around  the  reef  alone eating algae. But once danger lurks, they all swim quickly from wherever they are along the reef and come together in a large school resembling an intimidating ocean animal to provide safety and security for all.  The nations of this world must act like the surgeon fish and all come together including Taiwan. Taiwan’s . million people must also be given a voice, as our UN charter states “We the peoples.” All the nations working together, we can overcome the challenges of our time, from COVID to climate, and act with integrity and resolve to leave a better world for our children. Mr. President, Brothers and Sisters of the UN – I am proud to stand among you and  champion  a  brighter  and  more  sustainable  world.      God  bless  us  all.  Kom  kmal mesulang. Thank You!    "

120,2021,TON,Tonga,"President,	It’s	been	over	a	year	and	a	half	from	when	the	COVID-	was	declared	a	pandemic,	disrupting	the	ebb	and	flow	of	economies	and	social	infrastructures	world-wide.		But	it	is	by	God’s	grace	that	 the	 Kingdom	 of	 Tonga	 remains	 COVID-	 free.	 	 And	 while	 so	 many	 lives	 have	 been	claimed	 in	 the	 wake	 of	 this	 pandemic,	 Tonga,	 now	 more	 than	 ever,	 commits	 to	multilateralism	 thereby	 supporting	 the	 theme	 for	 this	 session,	 aptly	 introduced	 by	 Your	Excellency	 as	 President	 of	 the	 General	 Assembly	 for	 the	 76th	 session	 entitled	 “Building	resilience	through	hope	–	to	recover	from	COVID-,	rebuild	sustainably,	respond	to	the	needs	of	the	planet,	respect	the	rights	of	people,	and	revitalise	the	United	Nations”.			On	that	note,	I	congratulate	Your	Excellency	on	the	assumption	of	your	presidency	at	the	76th	session	 of	 the	 United	 Nations	 General	 Assembly	 and	 assure	 you	 of	 our	 delegation’s	 full	support	throughout	this	session.		I	express	our	gratitude	to	your	predecessor,	His	Excellency	Mr.	 Volkan	 Bozkir	 in	 successfully	 spearheading	 the	 75th	 session	 of	 the	 General	 Assembly	during	unprecedented	and	most	difficult	times.		I	 congratulate	 His	 Excellency	 Mr.	 Antnio	 Guterres	 on	 his	 re-appointment	 as	 Secretary	General	 of	 the	 United	 Nations	 to	 a	 second	 term	 and	 commend	 his	 leadership	 in	 safely	navigating	the	operations	of	the	United	Nations	under	the	undesirable	circumstances	of	the	pandemic.			Mr.	President,	I	express	sincere	condolences	and	solidarity	with	all	Member	States	afflicted	in	the	loss	of	lives	due	to	the	pandemic	while	confronted	by	unprecedented	natural	disasters	and	other	tragedies.		While	Tonga	remains	COVID-	free,	we	have	not	been	spared	from	the	socio-economic	 consequences	 thereof,	 worsened	 by	 an	 already	 dire	 economic	 situation	 facing	many	Small	Island	Developing	States	(SIDS).			Tonga	 is	 fortunate	 to	 be	 the	 third	 country	 in	 the	 Pacific	 to	 receive	 the	 COVID-	 vaccine	doses	in	March	2021	through	the	COVAX	Facility.		To	date,	approximately	one	third	of	the	population	 have	 been	 vaccinated	 and	 Tonga	 aims	 to	 vaccinate	 up	 to	 	 percent	 of	 the	population	by	end	of	2022.			Accordingly,	Tonga	joins	other	leaders	in	calling	for	timely	and	equitable	access	to	COVID-	vaccines	while	supporting	a	WTO	TRIPS	waiver	for	COVID-	vaccines.		Tonga	supports	to	 strengthen	 regional	 and	 global	 early	 pandemic	 and	 disaster	 planning	 and	 resilience	building	efforts.	I	express	sincere	gratitude	to	all	development	partners,	including	the	governments	of	New	Zealand,	Australia,	China,	Japan,	United	States	of	America,	India,	United	Arab	Emirates,	to	name	but	a	few,	and	international	organizations	including	the	World	Health	Organization,	UNICEF,	 CEPI,	 Asian	 Development	 Bank	 and	 the	 World	 Bank	 for	 their	 most	 generous	financial	 and	 humanitarian	 assistance,	 through	 the	 COVAX	 Facility	 from	 which	 Tonga	 has	received	more	than	,000	doses	in	addition	to	logistic	and	other	support	which	have	aptly	facilitated	Tonga’s	response	to	remain	vigilant	amidst	this	global	pandemic.				 								Mr.	President,	In	 light	 of	 the	 continued	 situation	 of	 the	 COVID-,	 the	 fourth	 session	 of	 the	 Inter-governmental	 Conference	 on	 the	 Conservation	 and	 Sustainable	 use	 of	 Marine	 Biological	Diversity	of	Areas	Beyond	National	Jurisdiction	has	been	further	postponed	to	the	earliest	possible	available	date	in	2022.		The	progress	of	BBNJ	intersessional	work	through	dialogue	on	 relevant	 topics	 is	 well	 underway	 thereby	 keeping	 the	 momentum	 in	 this	 important	process.		Tonga	is	grateful	for	the	commitment	by	the	International	Seabed	Authority	(ISA)	to	further	building	the	capacity	of	developing	States	especially	through	the	recent	workshop	of	 the	 Abyssal	 Initiative	 project	 which	 was	 jointly	 organized	 by	 the	 ISA	 and	 the	 United	Nations	Department	of	Economic	and	Social	Affairs	(UNDESA)	in	July	2021	in	collaboration	with	the	Cook	Islands,	who	hosted	the	workshop,	and	with	the	support	of	the	Norwegian	Agency	 for	 Development	 Cooperation	 (NORAD).	 Tonga	 looks	 forward	 to	 hosting	 the	 final	workshop	of	the	Abyssal	Initiative	project	later	this	year.		Mr.	President,	Tonga	along	with	other	leaders	of	the	Pacific	Islands	Forum,	at	its	Fifty-First	Forum	Leaders’	meeting,	 recently	 held	 on	 	 August	 2021,	 once	 again	 reaffirm	 that	 Climate	 Change	 is	 the	single	greatest	threat	facing	the	Blue	Pacific	while	recommitting	to	the	goals	enshrined	in	the	Paris	 Agreement.	 	 Tonga	 is	 one	 of	 the	 most	 vulnerable	 countries	 in	 the	 world	 to	 climate	change	 due	 to	 geographical	 and	 economic	 factors.	 	 It	 has	 been	 ranked	 by	 the	 World	 Risk	Report	2017	as	the	second	most	at-risk	country	in	the	world	to	natural	disasters	such	as	cyclones,	flooding	and	sea	level	rise.			While	Tonga	contributes	to	a	negligible	amount	to	global	greenhouse	gas	emissions,	we	are	nonetheless	 ambitious	 in	 supporting	 the	 goal	 of	 limiting	 global	 warming	 through	 the	submission	of	our	second	Nationally	Determined	Contribution	(NDC)	in	2020	in	line	with	the	timeline	 agreed	 to	 under	 the	 Paris	 Agreement.	 	 Tonga	 also	 launched	 the	 Tonga	 Energy	Efficiency	Master	Plan	(TEEMP	for	2020	–	2030)	and	the	National	Certificate	on	Sustainable	Energy	(NCSE)	which	is	a	clear	testament	of	our	determination	to	achieving	a	sustainable	energy	future	while	mitigating	the	effects	of	climate	change.	Mr.	President,	Tonga	had	the	honour	of	co-chairing	the	Twenty-first	meeting	of	the	United	Nations	Open-ended	 Informal	 Consultative	 Process	 on	 Oceans	 and	 the	 Law	 of	 the	 Sea	 (ICP21)	 with	 the	Principality	of	Monaco	from		to		June	2021,	focusing	its	discussions	on	“Sea	level	rise	and	its	impacts”.		The	discussions	on	this	very	critical	and	timely	topic	for	Tonga	and	the	Pacific	brought	to	the	fore	the	need	for	accelerated	actions	to	slow	the	rate	of	increase	in	sea	level	rise.	Speaking	 of	 seal	 level	 rise,	 our	 Pacific	 Islands	 Forum	 leaders	 continue	 to	 note	 with	 grave	concern	the	threat	posed	by	sea	level	rise	to	our	Blue	Pacific	and	are	committed	to	ensuring	that	maritime	zones	of	Pacific	Member	States	are	delineated	in	accordance	with	the	1982	United	Nations	Convention	on	the	Law	of	the	Sea	(UNCLOS)	which	should	not	be	challenged	or	 reduced	 due	 to	 climate	 change	 related	 sea	 level	 rise.	 At	 their	 Fifty-First	 meeting	 on	 		 							August	 2021,	 the	 Pacific	 Islands	 Forum	 leaders	 supported	 the	 development	 of	 a	 draft	Declaration	on	Preserving	Maritime	Zones	in	the	face	of	Climate	Change-related	Sea-level	rise.		The	 Sixth	 Assessment	 Report	 of	 the	 Intergovernmental	 Panel	 on	 Climate	 Change	 (IPCC)	provides	 the	 “…most	 up-to-date	 physical	 understanding	 of	 the	 climate	 system	 and	 climate	change…”	(AR6	Climate	Change	2021,	IPCC	Report)	for	which	it	made	a	clarion	call	in	their	comprehensive	 assessment	 report	 on	 the	 Ocean	 and	 the	 Cryosphere	 for	 urgent	 action	 to	prioritize	 adaptation	 and	 mitigation	 measures.	 	 The	 2021	 IPCC	 Report	 alluded	 to	 “global-mean	sea	level	keeps	rising	even	in	the	lowest	scenarios”	of	low	emissions.		However,	should	countries	fail	to	reduce	greenhouse	gas	emissions,	presenting	a	high	emissions	scenario,	it	is	highly	likely	that	this	will	result	in	an	increase	on	average	of	sea	level	-	five	times	that	in	low	emissions,	and	such	is	not	an	option	specifically	for	Tonga	and	low-lying	small	island	States	in	the	Pacific	and	the	rest	of	the	world.	The	Pacific	region,	because	of	its	peculiar	setting	of	low-lying	small	island	States	and	atoll,	is	unfortunately	experiencing	sea	level	rise	at	a	faster	and	in	more	extensive	form	than	others,	to	which	are	most	vulnerable	to	sea	level	rise.		Accordingly,	the	adaptation	period	that	is	required	for	low	lying	coasts	such	as	Tonga	and	the	Pacific	region	will	require	a	shorter	time	to	 prepare	 than	 others.	 The	 impacts	 of	 which	 are	 set	 to	 hinder	 the	 progress	 of	 achieving	Sustainable	Development	Goals	and	the	2030	Agenda.		Mr.	President,	Achieving	 the	 crucial	 goal	 of	 limiting	 global	 warming	 to	 .	 degrees	 Celsius	 is	 a	 moral	obligation	of	each	country,	whereby	the	aggregated	individual	country	NDC	efforts	would	help	in	reducing	national	emissions	while	adapting	to	the	impacts	of	climate	change.			Thus,	Tonga	calls	on	major	emitters	around	the	globe	to	urgently	commit	to	stronger	climate	action	 through	 robust	 strategies	 developed	 to	 achieving	 a	 net	 zero	 carbon	 by	 2050.	 	 The	commitments	already	made	by	leading	countries	to	curb	greenhouse	gas	emissions	are	most	welcome	and	held	in	high	regard.		We	look	forward	to	participating	in	the	26th	United	Nations	Climate	Change	Conference	of	the	Parties	(COP	)	in	Glasgow,	United	Kingdom,	from		October	to		November	2021	with	the	view	to	accelerating	actions	towards	achieving	goals	of	the	Paris	Agreement.	Mr.	President,	The	Secretary-General’s	report	on	developments	and	issues	relating	to	ocean	affairs	and	the	law	 of	 the	 sea	 aptly	 addresses	 the	 continued	 importance	 of	 the	 “blue	 economy”.	 	 The	sustainable	use	of	the	ocean	resources,	and	preserving	the	health	of	ocean	ecosystems,	are	critical,	given	the	strong	linkages	between	the	people	of	the	Pacific	region	and	the	ocean	for	which	 they	 rely	 upon	 for	 their	 livelihood.	 	 The	 declining	 health	 of	 the	 oceans	 due	 to	 the	considerable	amount	of	living	coral	lost,	overfishing,	growing	number	of	ocean	acidification	and	 insurmountable	 problem	 of	 marine	 plastic	 pollution	 poses	 great	 risks	 to	 our	 food	security,	livelihoods,	and	the	environment,	for	which	is	deeply	felt	in	this	way	by	low-lying	coastal	States	and	small	island	developing	States	such	as	Tonga.				 							It	 is	 therefore	 urgent	 for	 us	 to	 call	 on	 others	 to	 assist	 in	 this	 endeavour	 of	 reversing	 the	declining	trend	affecting	the	ocean	as	our	traditional	provider.		Urgent	actions	are	needed	on	the	achievement	of	ocean-related	Sustainable	Development	Goals	and	the	implementation	of	 the	 SIDS	 Accelerated	 Modalities	 of	 Action	 (SAMOA)	 Pathway.	 	 This	 is	 becoming	 more	evident	in	the	wake	of	the	COVID-	pandemic	specifically	for	SIDS.	While	much	have	been	done	to	address	the	plight	of	the	oceans	and	pertinent	issues	raised	in	 respective	 reports,	 our	 delegation	 would	 like	 to	 stress	 the	 need	 for	 urgent	 actions	 to	addressing	 sustainable	 livelihoods	 while	 upholding	 the	 legal	 framework	 as	 set	 out	 under	UNCLOS.			Mr.	President,	It	is	very	disheartening	to	see	how	the	global	pandemic,	now	entering	the	second	year,	has	caused	 major	 disruptions	 in	 the	 achievement	 of	 the	 2030	 Agenda	 for	 Sustainable	Development.		We	acknowledge	the	comprehensive	Sustainable	Development	Goals	Report	2021	prepared	by	the	United	Nations	Department	of	Economic	and	Social	Affairs	(UNDESA)	in	collaboration	with	other	international	agencies.

121,2021,TUV,Tuvalu,"President, Distinguished Members of the General Assembly, Ladies and Gentlemen,  Checked Against Delivery Introduction .  On behalf of the Government of Tuvalu, I congratulate you on your election as President of the 76th United Nations General Assembly. Tuvalu has full confidence in your presidency. Let me also take this opportunity to thank the president of our 75th session, H.E. Volkan Bozkir, for a successful session under his leadership, despite the challenges to the work of the General Assembly due to the covid19 pandemic. .  I also want  to express  Tuvalu’s solidarity  with  Secretary  General, Antonio Guterres for his steadfast  leadership  in  guiding  this  august  body in  unprecedented  and  difficult  times  given the covid19 pandemic and ongoing conflicts in many parts of the world. Mr. President,  Theme of UNGA76. .  I applaud your theme for the 76th Session of the General Assembly.  We are yet again reminded that, since the Millennium Development Goals, and now the Sustainable Development Goals, we are not on track on the sustainable development targets we set for ourselves.  Two things are clear from the theme.  That is, we cannot build resilient and sustainable economies in isolation of, first, the needs of the planet, and, second, the protection of human rights. .  Tuvalu, with an average land elevation of no more than  meters above sea level, is extremely vulnerable to climate change, sea level rise, and natural disasters.  How strong will the next tropical cyclone be? How much longer can our islands support our livelihoods? Is there even a future for us on our islands?  .  With forced displacement due to climate change and sea level rise, what shall we do and where should we go?  What about our traditional culture and heritage? What  will happen to us? What happens  to  our  human  rights?  Will  Tuvalu  remain  a  member  state  of  the  UN  if  it  is  finally submerged? Who can help us, and will they help us?  Mr. President,         Checked Against Delivery .  These are the valid but difficult moral and political questions we, and millions of people in low lying countries and coastal areas, continue to grapple with.   Consequently, these same difficult questions  will  be  asked  by  those  of  us  who  remain  ignorant  of  climate  change.  Until  we  have answers to these difficult questions, sustainable development, for us, will only be wishful thinking and a short-term goal running on borrowed time.  Not a reality we can accomplish. . But hope is not all lost. For Tuvalu, we will cope and adapt. Statelessness is not an option for Tuvalu, and I am sure it is also not an option for any of us here today.  The international community must  now  consider  solutions  to  protect  the  rights  of  people  affected  by  the  impacts  of  climate change and to avoid chaotic responses to uncontrolled mass climate displacement. .  In  this  regard,  Tuvalu  is  spearheading  a  new  initiative  that  will  be  advanced  by  likeminded countries to advance efforts towards protecting the statehood of small atoll island nations facing existential  threats  from  sea  level  rise  and,  preserving  the  sovereignty,  rights  and  heritage  of affected nations and their populations. .    On  the  domestic  front,  we  have  streamlined  building  resilience  to  climate  change,  natural disasters, and external shocks into our  year national sustainable development strategy namely, Te Kete 2021 - 2030.  We have continued to enhance adaptation to climate change and sea level rise through the construction of raised reclamation and coastal protection systems and adopting new agricultural systems to respond to climate change and sea level rise.   .  We are grateful for the assistance provided through the Green Climate Fund (GCF), Global Environment  Facility  (GEF),  World  Bank,  Asian  Development  Bank,  and  other  development partners to enhance our resilience to climate change.  However, we must scale up this support to meet our growing adaptation needs, particularly our major development programmes such as land reclamation and land elevation, to strengthen our resilience to the slow onset of sea level rise which could potentially erase our God-given land from the face of the Earth. Mr. President, .  The cost of continuous rebuilding after every tropical cyclone and adapting to increasing sea levels leaves little fiscal space for investment in the SDGs.  Our global climate actions must focus on the root causes of climate change to break this cycle of costly and continuous rebuilding.  The one obvious sustainable solution is to stop and reverse increasing global temperatures.     .  To this end, the Kainaki II Declaration on Climate Change endorsed by Pacific Leaders in Tuvalu in 2019 calls for updated NDCs to keep the .℃ target, a global climate finance target of $100 billion and the replenishment of the Green Climate Fund to support urgent adaptation needs Checked Against Delivery and an end to inefficient and harmful fossil fuel subsidies including the phase out of coal.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Mr. President, .    As  we  move  closer  to  COP26,  we  make  the  same  call  on  developed  countries  and  major economies to demonstrate leadership. We need your commitment to fulfil the financial promises made in the Paris Agreement, including aligning global financial flows to be consistent with the objectives of the Paris Agreement.  .  The recent IPCC report on the Climate warns that we are inching closer to the point of no return. COP26 will be a make-or-break COP. To our developed countries, major economies, and emerging economies, we urge you to use your leadership roles to make COP26 a success. Climate change is already restricting our capacity to achieve sustainable development goals. Mr. President, Building Resilience with Hope .  Our United Nations has in place systems and processes to guide our efforts to build resilience and  build  back  better.  We  have  the  various  international  frameworks  stemming  from  the  2030 Agenda  for  Sustainable  Development,  the  Istanbul  Plan  of  Action  for  LDCs,  the  Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the Paris Agreement. It is evident that we also have the resources and the technology that we need. We must strive for strong political commitment. .  Mr. President, I therefore urge you to work to build political commitment and development cooperation with developed countries and major economies, including emerging economies.   Mr. President, .  Revitalizing the United Nations is critical to responding to our increasingly complicated global challenge. In terms of climate change, we applaud the appointment of the UNSG Special Adviser on Climate Change. And we look forward to the streamlining of climate change and security in the work of various UN bodies to build a UN system that is responsive to the needs of those most vulnerable to climate change.       Checked Against Delivery .  Covid19 has exposed the vulnerability of our food security systems.   For Tuvalu, our food security and agricultural capacity is our bloodline. It is therefore paramount to keep our oceans clean and sustainable for our people and generations to come.  .  We look forward to the implementation of the outcomes of the UN Food Systems Summit to complement  and  scale  up  our  existing  food  security  systems  and  programs  to  adapt  better  to climate change and support progress on the SDGs. Mr. President, . I thank you for the recognition that to build resilience, we must respect the rights of people and that the UN  must be  revitalized to  uphold  the  rights  of all people of the world—people it was established to serve and protect.   .  On this very note, Tuvalu calls for the recognition of the rights of the people of Taiwan to the UN premises. The UN system was established to serve the public interest of all peoples.  Having unhindered access to the family of nations should be a right for all, not a privilege for some. .  It  is  most  regrettable  to  see  the  ongoing  injustice  of  Taiwanese  people  being  barred  from accessing UN premises for visits and meetings simply because the UN fails to recognize Republic of China (Taiwan) passports, which are, in fact accepted by almost every country in the world. Likewise,  Taiwanese  media  outlets  and  journalists  cannot  obtain  accreditation  to  cover  UN meetings and events.  .  It is alarming that civic space in the UN and freedom of the press are being restricted. It is also unjustifiable  that  a  person’s  access  to  UN  premises  now  depends  on  nationality  rather  than  on safety and security grounds. Granting Taiwanese passport holders’ access to UN premises is an essential  step  for  the  meaningful  participation  of  Taiwan  and  the  Taiwanese  people  in  the  UN system. .  It is also regrettable that the people of Cuba continue to face the economic burden of a long, unilateral  economic  embargo.  Keeping  these  measures  in  place  has  robbed  Cuba  of  the international collaboration and assistance it has required to recover from the covid19 pandemic and build back better.  The embargo has ignored the principles of the Charter of the United Nations     and neglected the human rights  and the spirit of cooperation espoused in the 2030 Agenda  for Checked Against Delivery Sustainable Development. Mr. President, .  As you may realize, I have been talking mainly about climate change.  This is not to diminish the  importance  of  other  global  challenges  which  Tuvalu  also  continues  to  face.    Rather,  it  is because  for  us,  climate  change  is  the  single  greatest  threat  to  the  lives,  prosperity,  and  human security of our people.  It is an existential threat. Tuvalu is unable to build resilience with hope, as noted in the theme of this 76th Session of the General Assembly, if climate change is allowed to continue on its current trajectory.  .  Finally, Mr. President, Tuvalu reiterates its commitment to multilateralism through unity. The Tuvalu 2021 Independence Day theme, “Unity in Word and Deed,” is a message I bring as a call to all members of the United Nations, to embrace our shared differences and unite in action to address climate change and its rampage on humankind. Working together as the global family of the United Nations, with the full respect for human rights and the needs of the planet, together we can build a sustainable future for planet Earth. I thank you Mr. President. Tuvalu Mo te Atua      "
